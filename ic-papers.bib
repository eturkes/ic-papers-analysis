  abstract = {It has been hypothesized that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most common treatment for major depression, affect mood through changes in immune function. However, the effects of SSRIs on inflammatory response are contradictory since these act either as anti- or pro-inflammatory drugs. Previous experimental and clinical studies showed that the quality of the living environment moderates the outcome of antidepressant treatment. Therefore, we hypothesized that the interplay between SSRIs and the environment may, at least partially, explain the apparent incongruence regarding the effects of SSRI treatment on the inflammatory response. In order to investigate such interplay, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to chronic stress to induce a depression-like phenotype and, subsequently, to fluoxetine treatment or vehicle (21 days) while being exposed to either an enriched or a stressful condition. At the end of treatment, we measured the expression levels of several anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in the whole hippocampus and in isolated microglia. We also determined microglial density, distribution, and morphology to investigate their surveillance state. Results show that the effects of fluoxetine treatment on inflammation and microglial function, as compared to vehicle, were dependent on the quality of the living environment. In particular, fluoxetine administered in the enriched condition increased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers compared to vehicle, while treatment in a stressful condition produced anti-inflammatory effects. These findings provide new insights regarding the effects of SSRIs on inflammation, which may be crucial to devise pharmacological strategies aimed at enhancing antidepressant efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Persistent neuropathic pain is a frequent consequence of peripheral nerve injuries, particularly in the elderly. Using the IntelliCage we studied if sciatic nerve injury obstructed learning and memory in young and aged mice, each in wild type and progranulin deficient mice, which develop premature signs of brain aging. Both young and aged mice developed long-term nerve injury-evoked hyperalgesia and allodynia. In both genotypes, aged mice with neuropathic pain showed high error rates in place avoidance acquisition tasks. However, once learnt, these aged mice with neuropathic pain showed a significantly stronger maintenance of the aversive memory. Nerve injury did not affect place preference behavior in neither genotype, neither in young nor aged mice. However, nerve injury in progranulin deficient mice impaired the learning of spatial sequences of awarded places, particularly in the aged mice. This task required a discrimination of clockwise and anti-clockwise sequences. The chaining failure occurred only in progranulin deficient mice after nerve injury, but not in sham operated or wildtype mice, suggesting that progranulin was particularly important for compensatory adaptations after nerve injury. In contrast, all aged mice with neuropathic pain, irrespective of the genotype, had a long maintenance of aversive memory suggesting a negative alliance and possibly mutual aggravation of chronic neuropathic pain and aversive memory at old age.},

  abstract = {A barrage of information constantly assaults our senses, of which only a fraction is relevant at any given point in time. However, the neural circuitry supporting the suppression of irrelevant sensory distractors is not completely understood. The claustrum, a circuit hub with vast cortical connectivity, is an intriguing brain structure, whose restrictive anatomy, thin and elongated, has precluded functional investigation. Here, we describe the use of Egr2-CRE mice to access genetically defined claustral neurons. Utilizing conditional viruses for anterograde axonal labeling and retrograde trans-synaptic tracing, we validated this transgenic model for accessing the claustrum and extended the known repertoire of claustral input/ output connectivity. Addressing the function of the claustrum, we inactivated CLEgr2+ neurons, chronically as well as acutely, in mice performing an automated two-alternative forced-choice behavioral task. Strikingly, inhibition of CLEgr2+ neurons did not significantly impact task performance under varying delay times and cue durations, but revealed a selective role for the claustrum in supporting performance in the presence of an irrelevant auditory distractor. Further investigation of behavior, in the naturalistic maternal pupretrieval task, replicated the result of sensitization to an auditory distractor following inhibition of CLEgr2+ neurons. Initiating investigation into the underlying mechanism, we found that activation of CLEgr2+ neurons modulated cortical sensory processing, suppressing tone representation in the auditory cortex. This functional study, utilizing selective genetic access, implicates the claustrum in supporting resilience to distraction, a fundamental aspect of attention.},

  abstract = {Exposure to arsenic from well water in developing countries is suspected to cause developmental neurotoxicity. Although, it has been demonstrated that exposure to sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) suppresses neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons in vitro, it is largely unknown how developmental exposure to NaAsO2 impairs higher brain function and affects cortical histology. Here, we investigated the effect of prenatal NaAsO2 exposure on the behavior of mice in adulthood, and evaluated histological changes in the prelimbic cortex (PrL), which is a part of the medial prefrontal cortex that is critically involved in cognition. Drinking water with or without NaAsO2 (85 ppm) was provided to pregnant C3H mice from gestational days 8 to 18, and offspring of both sexes were subjected to cognitive behavioral analyses at 60 weeks of age. The brains of female offspring were subsequently harvested and used for morphometrical analyses. We found that both male and female mice prenatally exposed to NaAsO2 displayed an impaired adaptation to repetitive reversal tasks. In morphometrical analyses of Nissl- or Golgi-stained tissue sections, we found that NaAsO2 exposure was associated with a significant increase in the number of pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI of the PrL, but not other layers of the PrL. More strikingly, prenatal NaAsO2 exposure was associated with a significant decrease in neurite length but not dendrite spine density in all layers of the PrL. Taken together, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to NaAsO2 leads to behavioral inflexibility in adulthood and cortical disarrangement in the PrL might contribute to this behavioral impairment.},

  abstract = {In adult rodents, decreasing hippocampal neurogenesis experimentally using different approaches often impairs performance in hippocampus-dependent processes. Nonetheless, functional relevance of adult neurogenesis is far from being unraveled, and deficits so far described in animal models often lack reproducibility. One hypothesis is that such differences might be the consequence of the extent of the methodological specificity used to alter neurogenesis rather than the extent to which adult neurogenesis is altered. To address this, we focused on cranial irradiation, the most widely used technique to impair hippocampal neurogenesis and consequentially induce hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits. To investigate the specificity of the technique, we thus exposed 4\textendash 5 months old female cyclin D2 knockout mice, a model lacking physiological levels of olfactory and hippocampal neurogenesis, to an X-ray dose of 10 Gy, reported to specifically affect transiently amplifying precursors. After a recovery period of 1.5 months, behavioral tests were performed and probed for locomotor activity, habituation, anxiety, and spatial learning and memory. Spatial learning in the Morris water maze was intact in all experimental groups. Although spatial memory retention assessed 24 h following acquisition was also intact in all mice, irradiated wild type and cyclin D2 knockout mice displayed memory deficits one week after acquisition. In addition, we observed significant differences in tests addressing anxiety and locomotor activity dependent on the technique used to alter neurogenesis. Whereas irradiated mice were hyperactive regardless of their genotype, cyclin D2 knockout mice were hypoactive in most of the tests and displayed altered habituation. The present study emphasizes that different approaches aimed at decreasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis may result in distinct behavioral impairments related to locomotion and anxiety. In contrast, spatial long-term memory retention is consistently altered after both approaches suggesting a plausible implication of hippocampal neurogenesis in this cognitive process.},

However, the social dimension has rarely been incorporated into the analysis due to methodological limitations. This study characterized the effects of neonatal social isolation (early deprivation, ED) on adult C57BL/6 mouse behavior in a social context using our recently developed behavioral test protocols for group-housed mice. During the first two postnatal weeks, half of the pups per dam were separated from their dam and littermates for 3 h per day (ED group). Post weaning, ED and control pups were electronically tagged and co-housed. At 12 weeks, the mixed cohorts were transferred to IntelliCages, equipped with computer-controlled operant chambers. Access to the chambers was used as an index to analyze novel object response, behavioral flexibility, and competitive dominance with minimal experimenter intervention. In general, ED had greater effects on males; ED males exhibited reduced body weight, increased novelty response, and were subordinate to control littermates when competing for reward access. Male ED mice also demonstrated mildly impaired reversal learning. Analyzing gene expression changes in brain regions controlling emotion, stress, spatial memory, and executive function revealed reduced BDNF and c-Fos in hippocampal CA1, enhanced c-Fos in the basolateral amygdala, reduced Map2 while enhanced HSD11{$\beta$}2 in prefrontal cortex of ED males. In male mice, it was suggested that neonatal social isolation results in sustained changes in social behavior with altered function of limbic and frontal cortices.},

  abstract = {Aging is accompanied by poor learning and memory abilities and by decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, a process that is also modulated by oxidative stress (OS). P66Shc has recently emerged as a novel mammalian gerontogene able to affect healthspan during aging. Deletion of this gene in mice leads to reduced OS accompanied by decreased incidence of age-related pathologies and reduced signs of behavioral aging. We hypothesized that p66Shc2/2 mutants might show increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory processes. To this aim, granule cell number, proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and cell death were assessed in the hippocampus in senescent p66Shc2/2 [knock out (KO)] and p66Shc1/1 [wild type (WT)] male and female mice. Spatial learning abilities and spontaneous activity were also investigated in a multifunctional behavioral system\textemdash IntelliCages. The behavioral analysis revealed that females in general perform better in spatial learning tasks, with genotype effects being apparent in the activity pattern only. Likewise, all females showed increased neuronal differentiation, whereas increased proliferation was found only in those belonging to the p66Shc2/2 genotype, indicating that they might be protected from precursor cell loss. The number of dying cells was not affected by genotype or sex; however, all KO mice showed less granule cells than WT. Overall, our data suggest that hippocampal function is protected in the female gender at older age, an effect amplified by reduced OS in the p66Shc2/2 mutant. VC 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Antidepressants represent the standard treatment for major depression. However, their efficacy is variable and incomplete. A growing number of studies suggest that the environment plays a major role in determining the efficacy of these drugs, specifically of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). A recent hypothesis posits that the increase in serotonin levels induced by SSRI may not affect mood per se, but enhances neural plasticity and, consequently, renders the individual more susceptible to the influence of the environment. Thus, SSRI administration in a favorable environment would lead to a reduction of symptoms, while in a stressful environment might lead to a worse prognosis. To test this hypothesis, we treated C57BL/6 adult male mice with chronic fluoxetine while exposing them to either (i) an enriched environment, after exposure to a chronic stress period aimed at inducing a depression-like phenotype, or (ii) a stressful environment. Anhedonia, brain BDNF and circulating corticosterone levels, considered endophenotypes of depression, were investigated. Mice treated with fluoxetine in an enriched condition improved their depression-like phenotype compared to controls, displaying higher saccharin preference, higher brain BDNF levels and reduced corticosterone levels. By contrast, when chronic fluoxetine administration occurred in a stressful condition, mice showed a more distinct worsening of the depression-like profile, displaying a faster decrease of saccharin preference, lower brain BDNF levels and increased corticosterone levels. Our findings suggest that the effect of SSRI on depression-like phenotypes in mice is not determined by the drug per se but is induced by the drug and driven by the environment. These findings may be helpful to explain variable effects of SSRI found in clinical practice and to device strategies aimed at enhancing their efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Early experiences profoundly affect the adult coping response to stress and, consequently, adult vulnerability to psychopathologies triggered by stressing conditions, such as major depression. Though studies in animal models have demonstrated that individuals reared in different conditions are differently vulnerable to a stressor of a specific quality, no information is available as to whether such vulnerability differs when facing stressors of different qualities. To this purpose, we reared C57BL/6 male mice either in standard laboratory rearing condition (SN) or in Communal Nest (CN) condition, the latter consisting of a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior until weaning. We scored the amount of interactions with the mother and with peers and found that CN is a form of social enrichment because both these components are significantly increased. At adulthood, we exposed SN and CN mice, for 4 weeks, to either a physical (forced swim) or a social stress (social instability). Immediately before, at week 1 and at week 4 of the stress procedure, corticosterone levels and the hedonic profile were measured. The results show that CN mice are more resilient to social stress than SN mice since they displayed no anhedonia and lower corticosterone levels. By contrast, both experimental groups were similarly vulnerable to physical stress. Overall, our results show that, in male mice, the adult vulnerability to stress changes according to the quality of the stressor, as a function of early experiences. In addition, the stressor to which CN mice are resilient is qualitatively similar to the stimuli they have experienced early on, both concerning the social domain.},

  abstract = {Early experiences shape brain function and behavior and, consequently, vulnerability to psychopathology at adulthood. Here we exploited the mouse communal nest (CN) paradigm in order to investigate the effect of the early social environment on the emergence of endophenotypes of depression and on antidepressant efficacy at adulthood. CN, which consists in a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior until weaning, is characterized by high levels of maternal behavior and peer interactions, thus representing an highly stimulating environment. Our results show that, when compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (SN), adult CN mice exhibited greater sucrose preference on the first days of the test, displayed reduced anhedonia during social stress and had lower corticosterone levels after acute and prolonged social stress. Furthermore, in line with previous work, CN displayed longer immobility than SN mice in the forced swim test. Here we show that such behavioral response is differently affected by antidepressants according to early experiences. A 3-week fluoxetine treatment affected only SN mice, leading to an increase of immobility duration up to the levels showed by CN mice, while acute fluoxetine administration decreased immobility duration in both groups. These results show that being reared in a CN profoundly changes developmental trajectories, reducing the adult display of endophenotypes of depression and modifying response to antidepressants. The present findings suggest that early experiences represent one of those factors to be taken into account to identify the appropriate individual pharmacological strategy to treat depression in patients.},

We focus here on the function of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and its phosphorylation by CaMKII in spontaneous learning about reward location in female mice. We show that formation of reward location memory leads to downregulation of PSD-95 protein in dendritic spines of the             stratum radiatum             , area CA1, and selective shrinkage of dendritic spines that contain PSD-95. ShRNA-driven, long-term downregulation of PSD-95 in the area CA1 decreases precision of memory. Autophosphorylation deficient CaMKII mutant mice (CaMKII:T286A) need more time than wild-type animals to learn the location of reward. The same impairment is observed after CA1-targeted overexpression of CaMKII phosphorylation-deficient form of PSD-95 (PSD-95:S73A). In contrast to young adult mice, in aged animals reward location learning affects only spines that lack PSD-95. The frequency and size of the spines without PSD-95 are increased, while shRNA targeted to PSD-95 affects neither speed of learning nor precision of memory indicating alternative mechanisms to support successful memory formation in old mice. Altogether, our data suggest that dynamic regulation of PSD-95 expression is a mechanism that accelerates learning and improves precision of reward location memory in young mice. The function of PSD-95 in memory processes changes in aged animals.},

  abstract = {Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and is implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. The GABAB receptors are G-protein coupled receptors consisting of principle subunits and auxiliary potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) subunits. The KCTD subunits 8, 12, 12b and 16 are cytosolic proteins that determine the kinetics of the GABAB receptor response. Previously, we demonstrated that Kctd12 null mutant mice (Kctd12-/-) exhibit increased auditory fear learning and that Kctd12+/- mice show altered circadian activity, as well as increased intrinsic excitability in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. KCTD16 has been demonstrated to influence neuronal excitability by regulating GABAB receptor-mediated gating of postsynaptic ion channels. In the present study we investigated for behavioural endophenotypes in Kctd16-/- and Kctd16+/- mice. Compared with wild-type (WT) littermates, auditory and contextual fear conditioning were normal in both Kctd16-/- and Kctd16+/- mice. When fear memory was tested on the following day, Kctd16-/- mice exhibited less extinction of auditory fear memory relative to WT and Kctd16+/- mice, as well as more contextual fear memory relative to WT and, in particular, Kctd16+/- mice. Relative to WT, both Kctd16+/- and Kctd16-/- mice exhibited normal circadian activity. This study adds to the evidence that auxillary KCTD subunits of GABAB receptors contribute to the regulation of behaviours that could constitute endophenotypes for hyper-reactivity to aversive stimuli in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {The similarity between sickness behavior syndrome (SBS) in infection and autoimmune disorders and certain symptoms in major depressive disorder (MDD), and the high co-morbidity of autoimmune disorders and MDD, constitutes some of the major evidence for the immune-inflammation hypothesis of MDD. CD40 ligand-CD40 immune-activation is important in host response to infection and in development of autoimmunity. Mice given a single intra-peritoneal injection of CD40 agonist antibody (CD40AB) develop SBS for 2\textendash 3 days characterized by weight loss and increased sleep, effects that are dependent on the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Here we report that CD40AB also induces behavioral effects that extend beyond acute SBS and co-occur with but are not mediated by kynurenine pathway activation and recovery. CD40AB led to decreased saccharin drinking (days 1\textendash 7) and decreased Pavlovian fear conditioning (days 5\textendash 6), and was without effect on physical fatigue (day 5). These behavioral effects co-occurred with increased plasma and brain levels of kynurenine and its metabolites (days 1\textendash 7/8). Co-injection of TNF blocker etanercept with CD40AB prevented each of SBS, reduced saccharin drinking, and kynurenine pathway activation in plasma and brain. Repeated oral administration of a selective indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor blocked activation of the kynurenine pathway but was without effect on SBS and saccharin drinking. This study provides novel evidence that CD40-TNF activation induces deficits in saccharin drinking and Pavlovian fear learning and activates the kynurenine pathway, and that CD40-TNF activation of the kynurenine pathway is not necessary for induction of the acute or extended SBS effects.},

  abstract = {The way animals respond to a stimulus depends largely on an internal comparison between the current sensation and the memory of previous stimuli and outcomes. We know little about the accuracy with which the physical properties of the stimuli influence this type of memorybased discriminative decisions. Research has focused largely on discriminations between stimuli presented in quick succession, where animals can make relative inferences (same or different; higher or lower) from trial to trial. In the current study we used a memory-based task to explore how the stimulus' physical properties, in this case tone frequency, affect auditory discrimination and generalization in mice. Mice performed ad libitum while living in groups in their home quarters. We found that the frequency distance between safe and conditioned sounds had a constraining effect on discrimination. As the safe-to-conditioned distance decreased across groups, performance deteriorated rapidly, even for frequency differences significantly larger than reported discrimination thresholds. Generalization width was influenced both by the physical distance and the previous experience of the mice, and was not accompanied by a decrease in sensory acuity. In conclusion, memory-based discriminations along a single stimulus dimension are inherently hard, reflecting a high overlap between the memory traces of the relevant stimuli. Memory-based discriminations rely therefore on wide sensory filters.},

To mimic the disease, mice are fed a cuprizone-supplemented diet for 5 weeks, which leads to demyelination of white and grey matter regions, with the corpus callosum being the most susceptible to cuprizone intoxication. Although this model is highly exploited, classical behavioural tests showed inconsistent results. Objective: In our study, we aimed to use the automated system Intellicage to phenotype the behaviour of cuprizone-fed mice. Methods: Mice were continuously monitored during the 5 weeks of intoxication in their home cages, with minimal interference from the experimenter. Mice were assessed for spontaneous activity, fine movements, and impulsivity. Results: Consistently, cuprizone-fed mice showed reduced activity and impulsivity throughout the test period. These behavioral results were confirmed by repeating the battery of behavioral tests in a second cohort of cuprizone-fed mice. Our results suggest that the behavioural phenotyping of cuprizone-fed mice using Intellicage is reproducible and sensitive enough to detect changes normally missed in standard behavioral test batteries. Conclusion: Using a reproducible and standardized method to assess behavioral changes in mice intoxicated with cuprizone is crucial to better understand the disease as well as the functional outcome of treatments.},

Ideally, behavioral tests improve the predictive validity of studies on animals by mirroring the functional impact of AD-like neuropathology. Learning and memory studies in APP transgenic models have been difficult to replicate. Standardization of procedures, automatization or improved protocol design can improve reproducibility. Here the IntelliCage, an automated system, was used for behavioral testing of APP female transgenic mice with both the Arctic and Swedish mutations, the tgArcSwe model. Protocols covering exploration, operant learning, place learning and extinction of place preference as well as passive avoidance tests were used for longitudinal characterization of behavior. Differences in exploratory activity were significant at four months of age, when plaque-free tg-ArcSwe mice visited less frequently the IntelliCage corners and initially performed fewer visits with licks compared to non-tg animals, inside the new environment. Fourteen months old tg-ArcSwe mice required a longer time to re-habituate to the IntelliCages than non-tg mice. At both ages tg-ArcSwe mice perseverated in place preference extinction test. Fourteen months old tg-ArcSwe mice were impaired in hippocampus-dependent spatial passive avoidance learning. This deficit was found to inversely correlate to calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. Reduced water intake and body weight were observed in 4 months old tg-ArcSwe animals. The body weight difference increased with age. Thus behavioral and metabolic changes in the tg-ArcSwe APP model were detected using the IntelliCage, a system which provides the opportunity for standardized automated longitudinal behavioral phenotyping.},

This decision may be based both on learned information and on sensory aspects of perception. In the present study we describe frequency processing in the behaving mouse using both discrimination and generalization as two key aspects of behaviour. We used a novel naturalistic behavioural apparatus designed for mice, the Audiobox, and paradigm contingencies that were identical for both auditory discrimination and generalization, the latter measured using latent inhibition. Mice learned to discriminate between frequencies that were an octave apart in a single trial. They showed significant discrimination between tone frequencies that were as close as 4\textendash 7\%, and had d' of about 1 for DF of around 10\%. In contrast, pre-exposure frequencies that were half an octave or less below the conditioned tone elicited latent inhibition, showing a generalization bandwidth of at least half an octave. Thus, in the same apparatus and using the same general memory paradigm, mice showed generalization gradients that were considerably wider than their discrimination threshold, indicating that environmental requirements and previous experience can determine whether the same two frequencies will be considered same or different. Remarkably, generalization gradients paralleled the typical bandwidths established in the auditory periphery and midbrain, suggesting that frequencies may be considered similar when falling within the same critical band.},

Specifically, female mice revealed higher activity, decreased sucrose preference, impaired reversal and place-time-reward learning. Furthermore, female mice reacted more sensitively than males to reward-withdrawal showing a negative emotional contrast/ Crespi-effect. In a series of validation experiments, we tested mice with different pathologies, including neuroligin-3 deficient mice (male Nlgn3y/- and female Nlgn3+/-) for autistic behavior, oligodendrocyte-specific erythropoietin receptor knockout (oEpoR-/-) mice for cognitive impairment, as well as mouse models of renal failure (unilateral ureteral obstruction and 5/6 nephrectomy) and of type 2 diabetes (ApoE-/-) \textendash{} for delineating potentially confounding effects of motivational factors (thirst, glucose-craving) on learning and memory assessments.

Renal failure led to increased water intake, and diabetic metabolism to enhanced glucose preference, limiting interpretation of hereon based learning and memory performance in these mice.

  abstract = {There has been a long-standing need to develop efficient and standardized behavioral test methods for evaluating higher-order brain functions in mice. Here, we developed and validated a behavioral flexibility test in mice using IntelliCage, a fully automated behavioral analysis system for mice in a group-housed environment. We first developed a ``behavioral sequencing task'' in the IntelliCage that enables us to assess the learning ability of place discrimination and behavioral sequence for reward acquisition. In the serial reversal learning using the task, the discriminated spatial patterns of the rewarded and never-rewarded places were serially reversed, and thus, mice were accordingly expected to realign the previously acquired behavioral sequence. In general, the tested mice showed rapid acquisition of the behavioral sequencing task and behavioral flexibility in the subsequent serial reversal stages both in intra- and inter-session analyses. It was found that essentially the same results were obtained among three different laboratories, which confirm the high stability of the present test protocol in different strains of mice (C57BL/6, DBA/2, and ICR). In particular, the most trained cohort of C57BL/6 mice achieved a markedly rapid adaptation to the reversal task in the final phase of the long-term serial reversal test, which possibly indicated that the mice adapted to the ``reversal rule'' itself. In conclusion, the newly developed behavioral test was shown to be a valid assay of behavioral flexibility in mice, and is expected to be utilized in tests of mouse models of cognitive deficits.},

However, it has been extremely difficult to detect and assess such causality particularly at low exposure levels. To address this question, we here investigated higher brain function in mice exposed to dioxin in utero and via lactation by using our recently developed automated behavioral flexibility test and immunohistochemistry of neuronal activation markers Arc, at the 14 brain areas. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were given orally a low dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at a dose of either 0, 0.6 or 3.0 mg/kg on gestation day 12.5. When the pups reached adulthood, they were group-housed in IntelliCage to assess their behavior. As a result, the offspring born to dams exposed to 0.6 mg TCDD/kg were shown to have behavioral inflexibility, compulsive repetitive behavior, and dramatically lowered competitive dominance. In these mice, immunohistochemistry of Arc exhibited the signs of hypoactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hyperactivation of the amygdala. Intriguingly, mice exposed to 3.0 mg/kg were hardly affected in both the behavioral and neuronal activation indices, indicating that the robust, nonmonotonic dose-response relationship. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that perinatal exposure to a low dose of TCDD in mice develops executive function deficits and social behavioral abnormality accompanied with the signs of imbalanced mPFC-amygdala activation.},

Here, we studied the consequences of LPAR2 deletion or antagonism on various aspects of cognition using a set of behavioral and electrophysiological analyses. Hippocampal neuronal network activity was decreased in middle-aged L\- PAR2-/- mice, whereas hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was increased suggesting cognitive advantages of \-LPAR2-/- mice. In line with the lower excitability, RNAseq studies revealed reduced transcription of neuronal activity markers in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in na\"ive \-LPAR2-/- mice, including ARC, FOS, FOSB, NR4A, NPAS4 and EGR2. L\- PAR2-/- mice behaved similarly to wildtype controls in maze tests of spatial or social learning and memory but showed faster and accurate responses in a 5-choice serial reaction touchscreen task requiring high attention and fast spatial discrimination. In IntelliCage learning experiments, \-LPAR2-/- were less active during daytime but normally active at night, and showed higher accuracy and attention to LED cues during active times. Overall, they maintained equal or superior licking success with fewer trials. Pharmacological block of the LPAR2 receptor recapitulated the L\- PAR2-/- phenotype, which was characterized by economic corner usage, stronger daytime resting behavior and higher proportions of correct trials. We conclude that LPAR2 stabilizes neuronal network excitability upon aging and allows for more efficient use of resting periods, better memory consolidation and better performance in tasks requiring high selective attention. Therapeutic LPAR2 antagonism may alleviate aging-associated cognitive dysfunctions.},

FOXP1               haploinsufficiency is characterized by autistic behavior, language impairment, and intellectual disability, but feeding difficulties and gastrointestinal problems have also been reported. Whether these are primary impairments, the result of altered eating behavior, or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. To address this question, we investigated               Foxp1               +/-               mice reflecting               FOXP1               haploinsufficiency. These animals show decreased body weight and altered feeding behavior with reduced food and water intake. A pronounced muscular atrophy was detected in the esophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitric oxide-induced relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter was impaired and achalasia was confirmed in vivo by manometry. Foxp1 targets (               Nexn               ,               Rbms3               , and               Wls               ) identified in the brain were dysregulated in the adult               Foxp1               +/-               esophagus. Total gastrointestinal transit was significantly prolonged due to impaired colonic contractility. Our results have uncovered a previously unknown dysfunction (achalasia and impaired gut motility) that explains the gastrointestinal disturbances in patients with FOXP1 syndrome, with potential wider relevance for autism.},

This study explored whether the newly-developed Intellicage system could be used to compare these species in simple spatial learning paradigms. The Intellicage is essentially a group-housing cage that also allows continuous automatic recording of each individual's behaviour. Seven wild-caught bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) were compared with seven wildcaught long-tailed wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in the Intellicage system over 9 days. During the first 90 min after entering the cage, the wood mice were substantially more exploratory than the bank voles (P = 0.003). Over subsequent days, both species showed nocturnal activity increases with voles being 3.7 times more active overall. In the spatial learning paradigms, there were significant species-by-time interactions with wood mice outperforming bank voles on both place learning (P = 0.027) and subsequent reversal (P = 0.006). Conclusions are firstly that the wood mice show superior learning abilities in this paradigm, and secondly that the Intellicage serves as a valuable cognitive testing arena for small wild rodents, or for circumstances where cognition must be compared independent of different responses to handling or novel environments.},

However, the mechanisms by which activity regulates myelination and the extent to which myelin plasticity contributes to non-motor cognitive functions remain incompletely understood. Using a mouse model of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), we recently demonstrated that methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy induces complex glial dysfunction for which microglial activation is central. Here, we demonstrate that remote MTX exposure blocks activity-regulated myelination. MTX decreases cortical Bdnf expression, which is restored by microglial depletion. Bdnf-TrkB signaling is a required component of activity-dependent myelination. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-specific TrkB deletion in chemotherapy-naive mice results in impaired cognitive behavioral performance. A small-molecule TrkB agonist rescues both myelination and cognitive impairment after MTX chemotherapy. This rescue after MTX depends on intact TrkB expression in OPCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism required for adaptive myelination that is aberrant in CRCI due to microglial activation.},

The functional role of alternative splicing of tau e.g. exon 10 has never been examined in vivo, although genetic studies suggest that it is important to neurodegenerative disease. Results: Gene-targeting was used to delete exon 10 in murine tau on both alleles (E10-/-) to study its functional role. Moreover, mice devoid of exon 10 (E10+/-) on one allele were generated to investigate the effects of 1:1 balanced expression of 4R-/3R-tau protein, since equal amounts of 4R-/3R-tau protein are synthesized in human brain. Middle-aged E10-/- mice displayed sensorimotor disturbances in the rotarod when compared to age-matched E10+/- and wild-type mice, and their muscular grip strength was less than that of E10+/- mice. The performance of E10+/- mice and wild-type mice (E10+/+) was similar in sensorimotor tests. Cognitive abilities or anxiety-like behaviours did not depend on exon 10 in tau, and neither pathological inclusions nor gene-dependent morphological abnormalities were found. Conclusion: Ablation of exon 10 in the murine tau gene alters alternative splicing and tau protein synthesis which results in mild sensorimotor phenotypes with aging. Presumably related microtubule-stabilizing genes rescue other functions.},

  abstract = {Opioid signaling controls the activity of the brain's reward system. It is involved in signaling the hedonic effects of rewards and has essential roles in reinforcement and motivational processes. Here, we focused on opioid signaling through mu and delta receptors on dopaminoceptive neurons and evaluated the role these receptors play in reward-driven behaviors. We generated a genetically modified mouse with selective double knockdown of mu and delta opioid receptors in neurons expressing dopamine receptor D1. Selective expression of the transgene was confirmed using immunostaining. Knockdown was validated by measuring the effects of selective opioid receptor agonists on neuronal membrane currents using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. We found that in the nucleus accumbens of control mice, the majority of dopamine receptor D1-expressing neurons were sensitive to a mu or delta opioid agonist. In mutant mice, the response to the delta receptor agonist was blocked, while the effects of the mu agonist were strongly attenuated. Behaviorally, the mice had no obvious impairments. The mutation did not affect the sensitivity to the rewarding effects of morphine injections or social contact and had no effect on preference for sweet taste. Knockdown had a moderate effect on motor activity in some of the tests performed, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. Thus, we found that knocking down mu and delta receptors on dopamine receptor D1-expressing cells does not appreciably affect some of the reward-driven behaviors previously attributed to opioid signaling.},

  abstract = {Inflammation or injuries of the trigeminal nerve are often associated with persistent facial pain and its sequelae. A number of models have been described to study trigeminal pain in rodents, but the long-lasting behavioral consequences are unknown. This study characterizes the impact of a distal infraorbital nerve injury, called DIONI, which consists of ligature and transection of distal fibers of the infraorbital nerve. We assessed nociception using a conflict paradigm and optogenetics, and a set of reward, aversion, spatial, temporal, and competition tasks in the IntelliCage to study multiple aspects of cognition, circadian rhythms, and social interactions in groups of mice in home cage environments. Mice with DIONI developed cold and mechanical allodynia, and hypersensitivity towards blue light stimulation. They maintained a long-lasting memory of aversive stimuli (airpuff from above), but had no difficulty in learning appetitive tasks, which consisted in developing a preference for a rewarding corner in the IntelliCage. Indeed, they were more strongly ``addicted'' to sugar than sham mice but temporarily failed to relearn the location of rewarding sites after corner switching (reversal learning). They were mildly overactive in some tasks but without disruptions of circadian rhythms or impact on social structure. They adopted a strategy to maintain licking with fewer nosepokes, presumably trying to avoid mechanical stimulation of the snout. The results suggest that mice with DIONI develop strong aversive memories and some cognitive inflexibility, but create adaptive strategies to cope with the persistent trigeminal hypersensitivity.},

  abstract = {Affective and cognitive processing of nociception contributes to the development of chronic pain and vice versa, pain may precipitate psychopathologic symptoms. We hypothesized a higher risk for the latter with immanent neurologic diseases and studied this potential interrelationship in progranulin-deficient mice, which are a model for frontotemporal dementia, a disease dominated by behavioral abnormalities in humans. Young na\"ive progranulin deficient mice behaved normal in tests of short-term memory, anxiety, depression and nociception, but after peripheral nerve injury, they showed attention-deficit and depression-like behavior, over-activity, loss of shelter-seeking, reduced impulse control and compulsive feeding behavior, which did not occur in equally injured controls. Hence, only the interaction of `pain x progranulin deficiency' resulted in the complex phenotype at young age, but neither pain nor progranulin deficiency alone. A deep proteome analysis of the prefrontal cortex and olfactory bulb revealed progranulin-dependent alterations of proteins involved in synaptic transport, including neurotransmitter transporters of the solute carrier superfamily. In particular, progranulin deficiency was associated with a deficiency of nuclear and synaptic zinc transporters (ZnT9/Slc30a9; ZnT3/Slc30a3) with low plasma zinc. Dietary zinc supplementation partly normalized the attention deficit of progranulin-deficient mice, which was in part reminiscent of autism-like and compulsive behavior of synaptic zinc transporter Znt3knockout mice. Hence, the molecular studies point to defective zinc transport possibly contributing to progranulin-deficiency-associated psychopathology. Translated to humans, our data suggest that neuropathic pain may precipitate cognitive and psychopathological symptoms of an inherent, still silent neurodegenerative disease.},

Different tests have been proposed, but most of them consist of rather artificial confrontations of unfamiliar mice in novel arenas or are relying on social stress induced by aggressive conspecifics. Natural social interaction in home cage in laboratory has not been investigated well. IntelliCage is a fully automated home-cage system, where activity of the group-housed mice can be monitored along with various cognitive tasks. Here we report the behavioural profile of C57BL/6N (B6) and BALB/c (BALB) female mice in IntelliCage when separated by strain, followed by monitoring of activity and formation of `home-base' after mixing two strains. For that purpose, 3 cages were connected. Significant differences between the strains were established in baseline behaviour in conventional tests and in IntelliCage. The B6 mice showed reduced anxiety-like behaviour in open field and light-dark box, slightly enhanced exploratory activity in IntelliCage during initial adaptation and clearly distinct circadian activity. Mixing of two strains resulted in reduction of body weight and anhedonia in B6 mice. In addition, the B6 mice showed clear preference to previous home-cage, and formed a new home-base faster than BALB mice. In contrast, BALB mice showed enhanced activity and moving between the cages without showing any preference to previous home-cage. It could be argued that social challenge caused changes in both strains and different coping styles are responsible for behavioural manifestations. Altogether, this approach could be useful in modelling and validating mouse models for disorders with disturbed social behaviour.},

In visual cue and reversal tasks in the cross-maze, the NAc direct pathway was critical for learning acquisition. In contrast, the NAc indirect pathway was essential not only for learning flexibility, but also for subsequent acquisition of a new strategy. In place discrimination and serial reversal learning tasks in the IntelliCage, we showed that the NAc indirect pathway controls behavioral flexibility by suppressing the influence of previously correct behavioral strategies during the reversal stage. These basal ganglia circuit mechanisms provide new insight into pathophysiologies associated with compulsive behaviors, including addiction and obesity.},

Considerable evidence has demonstrated a critical role for the basal ganglia in the flexibility of behavioral strategies. These processes are guided by the activity of two discrete neuron types, dopamine D1- or D2-receptor expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-/D2-MSNs) in the basal ganglia circuit. We used a reversible neurotransmission blocking technique to examine the role of D1- and D2-MSNs in the acquisition and reversal learning of a place discrimination task in the IntelliCage. We demonstrated that D1- and D2-MSNs do not mediate the acquisition of the task, but that suppression of activity in D2-MSNs impairs reversal learning and increased perseverative errors. Additionally, global knockout of the dopamine D2L receptor isoform produced a similar behavioral phenotype to D2-MSN-blocked mice. We also showed that D2L receptors are necessary for visual discrimination and reversal learning. These results suggest that D2L receptors and D2-MSNs have a critical role in the homeostatic regulation of basal ganglia circuit for flexible behaviors.},

While we cannot control the genes we inherit, we can modify our environment. Understanding the role that social and environmental experiences play in alcohol and sucrose consumption is critical for developing preventative interventions and treatments for alcohol use disorders and obesity. Methods: We used the drinking in the dark two-\-bottle choice (2BC) model of ethanol and sucrose consumption to compare male C57BL/6 mice housed in the IntelliCage (an automated device capable of simultaneously measuring behaviors of up to 16 mice living in an enriched social environment) with mice housed in standard isolated and social environments. Results: Consistent with previous publications on ethanol-\-na\"ive and -\-experienced mice, social and environmental enrichment reduced ethanol preference. Isolated mice had the highest ethanol preference and IntelliCage mice the least, regardless of prior ethanol experience. In mice with no prior sucrose experience, the addition of social and environmental enrichment increased sucrose preference. However, moving isolated mice to enriched conditions did not affect sucrose preference in sucrose-\- experienced mice. Conclusions: The impact of social and environmental enrichment on ethanol consumption differs from sucrose consumption suggesting that interventions and treatments developed for alcohol use disorders may not be suitable for sucrose consumption disorders.},

Conversely, alternations of circadian rhythms are a risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders. This assumption is supported by animals with clock gene mutations which often display behaviors that resemble human psychiatric disorders. In this study, we performed an indepth behavioral analysis with male mice lacking the central clock genes Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (Cry1/2-/-), which are thus unable to express endogenous circadian rhythms. With wild-type and Cry1/2-/- mice, we performed an extensive behavioral analysis to study their cognitive abilities, social behavior, and their expression of depression-like and anxiety-like behavior. While Cry1/2-/- mice showed only mild abnormalities at cognitive and social behavioral levels, they were consistently more anxious than wildtype mice. Anxiety-like behavior was particularly evident in reduced mobility in new environments, altered ability to habituate, compensatory behavior, and consistent restless behavior across many behavioral tests. In line with their anxiety-like behavioral phenotype, Cry1/2-/- mice have higher cFos activity in the amygdala after exposure to an anxiogenic stressor than wild-type mice. In our study, we identified Cry1/2-/- mice as animals that qualify as a translational mouse model for anxiety disorder in humans because of its consistent behavior of restlessness, increased immobility, and dysfunctional habituation in new environments.},

Male mice were injected with 2 mmol/kg lithium chloride i.p. on postnatal day 9 (P9) and additional lithium injections, 1 mmol/kg, were administered at 24 h intervals for up to 7 days. BrdU was injected 4 h after lithium injections on P9 and P10. The left hemisphere received a single dose of 8 Gy (MV photons) on P11. The animals were euthanized 6 h or 7 weeks after IR. The number of BrdU-labeled cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the granule cell layer (GCL) 6 h after IR was 24\% higher in the lithium-treated mice. The number of proliferating, phospho-histone H3-positive cells in the SGZ 7 weeks after IR was 59\% higher in the lithium group, so the effect was long-lasting. The number of apoptotic cells in the SGZ 6 h after IR was lower in the lithium group, as judged by 3 different parameters, pyknosis, staining for active caspase-3 and TUNEL. Newly formed cells (BrdU-labeled 1 or 2 days before IR) showed the greatest degree of protection, as judged by 50\% fewer TUNEL-positive cells, whereas non-BrdU-labeled cells showed 38\% fewer TUNEL-positive cells 6 h after IR. Consequently, the growth retardation of the GCL was less pronounced in the lithium group. The number and size of microglia in the DG were also lower in the lithium group, indicating reduced inflammation. Learning was facilitated after lithium treatment, as judged by improved context-dependent fear conditioning, and improved place learning, as judged by assessment in the IntelliCage platform.},

It is often consumed as a substitute for heroin, but imposing itself unknown harms and addictive burdens. Mitragynine is the major psychostimulant constituent of kratom that has recently been reported to induce morphine-like behavioural and cognitive effects in rodents. The effects of chronic consumption on non-drug related behaviours are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic mitragynine treatment on spontaneous activity, rewardrelated behaviour and cognition in mice in an IntelliCage\textregistered{} system, and compared them with those of morphine and {$\Delta$}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We found that chronic mitragynine treatment significantly potentiated horizontal exploratory activity. It enhanced spontaneous sucrose preference and also its persistence when the preference had aversive consequences. Furthermore, mitragynine impaired place learning and its reversal. Thereby, mitragynine effects closely resembled that of morphine and THC sensitisation. These findings suggest that chronic mitragynine exposure enhances spontaneous locomotor activity and the preference for natural rewards, but impairs learning and memory. These findings confirm pleiotropic effects of mitragynine (kratom) on human lifestyle, but may also support the recognition of the drug's harm potential.},

Deletion of a2-chimaerin, but not a1-chimaerin, beginning during early development results in an increase in contextual fear learning in adult mice, whereas learning is not altered when a2-chimaerin is deleted only in adulthood. Our findings suggest that a2-chimaerin acts during development to establish normal cognitive ability in adulthood.},

The probability of receiving a reward in two of the cage corners changed between 0.9 and 0.3 every 48 h over a period of \textasciitilde 33 days. As expected, in most animals, the odds of repeating a corner choice were increased if that choice was previously rewarded. Interestingly, the time elapsed from the previous choice also influenced the probability of repeating the choice, and this effect was independent of previous outcome. Behavioral data were fitted to a series of reinforcement learning models. Best fits were achieved when the reward prediction update was coupled with separate learning rates from positive and negative outcomes and additionally a ``fictitious'' update of the expected value of the nonselected choice. Additional inclusion of a time-dependent decay of the expected values improved the fit marginally in some cases.},

  abstract = {The exact function of the adult brain neurogenesis remains elusive, although it has been suggested to play a role in learning and memory processes. In our studies, we employed cyclin D2 gene knockout (cD2 KO) mice showing impaired neurogenesis as well as decreased hippocampal size. However, irrespectively of the genetic background of cD2 KO mice, this phenotype resulted in neither deficits in the hippocampal-dependent learning ability nor the memory formation. In the present study, cD2 KO mice and control littermates were subjected to hippocampal-dependent behavioral tests with little or no learning component. The knockout mice showed significant impairment in such species-typical behaviors as nest construction, digging, and marble burying. They were building none or poorer nests, digging less robustly, and burying fewer marbles than control mice. Such impairments were previously described, e.g., in animals with hippocampal lesions. Moreover, cD2 KO animals were also more active in the open field and automated motility chamber as well as showed increased explorative behavior in IntelliCage. Both increased motility and explorative behaviors were previously observed in hippocampally lesioned animals. Finally, cD2 KO mice showed normal sucrose preference, however starting from the second exposure to the sweetened solution, while control animals displayed a strong preference immediately. Presented results suggest that either morphological abnormalities of the hippocampal formation or adult brain neurogenesis impairment (or both) alter hippocampal-dependent behaviors of mutant mice without influencing learning abilities. These results may also suggest that adult brain neurogenesis is involved in species-typical behaviors.},

  abstract = {Background: Besides the well-known effects of ghrelin on adiposity and food intake regulation, the ghrelin system has been shown to regulate aspects of behavior including anxiety and stress. However, the effect of virus-mediated overexpression of the ghrelin receptor in the amygdala has not previously been addressed directly. Methods: First, we examined the acute effect of peripheral ghrelin administration on anxiety- and depression-like behavior using the open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim, and tail suspension tests. Next, we examined the effect of peripheral ghrelin administration and ghrelin receptor deficiency on stress in a familiar and social environment using the Intellicage system. Importantly, we also used a novel approach to study ghrelin receptor signaling in the brain by overexpressing the ghrelin receptor in the amygdala. We examined the effect of ghrelin receptor overexpression on anxiety-related behavior before and after acute stress and measured the modulation of serotonin receptor expression. Results: We found that ghrelin caused an anxiolytic-like effect in both the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Additionally, it attenuated air-puff\textendash induced stress in the social environment, while the opposite was shown in ghrelin receptor deficient mice. Finally, we found that overexpression of the ghrelin receptor in the basolateral division of the amygdala caused an anxiolytic-like effect and decreased the 5HT1a receptor expression. Conclusions: Ghrelin administration and overexpression of the ghrelin receptor in the amygdala induces anxiolytic-like behavior. Since the ghrelin receptor has high constitutive activity, ligand-independent signaling in vivo may be important for the observed anxiolytic-like effects. The anxiolytic effects seem to be mediated independently from the HPA axis, potentially engaging the central serotonin system.},

  abstract = {Mutations in the X chromosomal tRNA 2{${'}$}-O-methyltransferase FTSJ1 cause intellectual disability (ID). Although the gene is ubiquitously expressed affected individuals present no consistent clinical features beyond ID. In order to study the pathological mechanism involved in the aetiology of FTSJ1 deficiency-related cognitive impairment, we generated and characterized an Ftsj1 deficient mouse line based on the gene trapped stem cell line RRD143. Apart from an impaired learning capacity these mice presented with several statistically significantly altered features related to behaviour, pain sensing, bone and energy metabolism, the immune and the hormone system as well as gene expression. These findings show that Ftsj1 deficiency in mammals is not phenotypically restricted to the brain but affects various organ systems. Re-examination of ID patients with FTSJ1 mutations from two previously reported families showed that several features observed in the mouse model were recapitulated in some of the patients. Though the clinical spectrum related to Ftsj1 deficiency in mouse and man is variable, we suggest that an increased pain threshold may be more common in patients with FTSJ1 deficiency. Our findings demonstrate novel roles for Ftsj1 in maintaining proper cellular and tissue functions in a mammalian organism.},

  abstract = {Radiotherapy in the treatment of pediatric brain tumors is often associated with debilitating late-appearing adverse effects, such as intellectual impairment. Areas in the brain harboring stem cells are particularly sensitive to irradiation (IR) and loss of these cells may contribute to cognitive deficits. It has been demonstrated that IR-induced inflammation negatively affects neural progenitor differentiation. In this study, we used mice lacking the third complement component (C3-/-) to investigate the role of complement in a mouse model of IR-induced injury to the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampus. C3-/- and wild type (WT) mice received a single, moderate dose of 8 Gy to the brain on postnatal day 10. The C3-/- mice displayed 55 \% more microglia (Iba-1+) and a trend towards increase in proliferating cells in the GCL compared to WT mice 7 days after IR. Importantly, months after IR C3/- mice made fewer errors than WT mice in a reversal learning test indicating better learning capacity in C3-/- mice after IR. Notably, months after IR C3-/- and WT mice had similar GCL volumes, survival of newborn cells (BrdU), microglia (Iba-1) and astrocyte (S100{$\beta$}) numbers in the GCL. In summary, our data show that the complement system contributes to IR-induced loss of proliferating cells and maladaptive inflammatory responses in the acute phase after IR, leading to impaired learning capacity in adulthood. Targeting the complement system is hence promising for future strategies to reduce the long-term adverse consequences of IR in the young brain.},

These complications include intellectual and memory impairments as well as perturbed growth and puberty. We investigated the long-term effects of a single 8 Gy irradiation dose to the brains of 14-day-old mice. Behavior was assessed one year after irradiation using IntelliCage and open field, followed by immunohistochemical investigation of proliferation and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We found a 61\% reduction in proliferation and survival (BrdU incorporation 4 weeks prior to sacrifice), 99\% decrease in neurogenesis (number of doublecortin-positive cells) and gliosis (12\% higher astrocyte density) one year following irradiation. Irradiated animals displayed increased activity in a novel environment but decreased activity in their home cage. Place learning in the IntelliCage was unaffected by irradiation but reversal learning was impaired. Irradiated animals persevered in visiting previously correct corners to a higher extent compared to control animals. Hence, despite the virtual absence of neurogenesis in these old mice, spatial learning could take place. Reversal learning however, where a previous memory was replaced with a new one, was partly impaired. This model is useful to study the so called late effects of radiotherapy to the young brain and to evaluate possible interventions.},

A family of BD and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) caused by a mutation of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1, SLC25A4) implicated that ANT1 mutations confer a risk of BD. Here, we sequenced ANT1 in 324 probands of NIMH bipolar disorder pedigrees and identified two BD patients carrying heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Behavioral analysis of brain specific Ant1 heterozygous conditional knockout (cKO) mice using lntelliCage showed a selective diminution in delay discounting. Delay discounting is the choice of smaller but immediate reward than larger but delayed reward and an index of impulsivity. Diminution of delay discounting suggests an increase in serotonergic activity. This finding was replicated by a 5-choice serial reaction time test. An anatomical screen showed accumulation of COX (cytochrome c oxidase) negative cells in dorsal raphe. Dorsal raphe neurons in the heterozygous cKO showed hyperexcitability, along with enhanced serotonin turnover in the nucleus accumbens and upregulation of Maob in dorsal raphe. These findings altogether suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction as the genetic risk of BD may cause vulnerability to BD by altering serotonergic neurotransmission.},

Although it is plausible that PBDD/DFs can also induce DNT, information regarding their neurotoxic potential is currently limited. Hence, in the present study, we examined the effects of in utero and lactational exposure to brominated dibenzofurans on infant and adult offspring behavior to understand the mechanism of PBDD/DFs toxicity and detect effective behavioral endpoints in DNT assessment. We analyzed the behavior of mouse offspring born to dams administered 2,3,7,8tetrabromodibenzofuran (2,3,7,8-TeBDF; dose of 0, 9, or 45 {$\mu$}g/kg) or 2,3,8-tribromodibenzofuran (2,3,8-TrBDF; dose of 0, 75.6, or 378 {$\mu$}g/kg) on gestational day 12.5. In mouse offspring born to dams exposed to 2,3,7,8TeBDF, the exploratory behavior in a novel environment in adulthood and ultrasonic vocalization (USV) during infancy were significantly reduced. Additionally, AhR-target genes, such as Cyp1a1, were induced in the liver of 2,3,7,8-TeBDF-exposed offspring in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, no significant changes in the infant and adult behaviors and expression level of AhR-target genes were observed in the 2,3,8-TrBDF-exposed offspring. These results suggest that 2,3,7,8-TeBDF can induce DNT and that the analysis of exploratory behavior in a novel environment and USV may be useful endpoints to assess DNT of dioxin-related substances.},

The mHb is characterized by the expression of specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor isoforms and the release of acetylcholine to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), the sole output region of the mHb. The specific function of this circuit, however, is poorly understood. Here we generated transgenic mice in which mHb cells were selectively ablated postnatally. These lesions led to large reductions in acetylcholine levels within the IPN. The mutant mice exhibited abnormalities in a wide range of behavioral domains. They tended to be hyperactive during the early night period and were maladapted when repeatedly exposed to new environments. Mutant mice also showed a high rate of premature responses in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), indicating impulsive and compulsive behavior. Additionally, mice also exhibited delay and effort aversion in a decision-making test, deficits in spatial memory, a subtle increase in anxiety levels, and attenuated sensorimotor gating. IntelliCage studies under social housing conditions confirmed hyperactivity, environmental maladaptation, and impulsive/compulsive behavior, delay discounting, deficits in long-term spatial memory, and reduced flexibility in complex learning paradigms. In 5-CSRTT and adaptation tasks, systemic administration of nicotine slowed down nose-poke reaction and enhanced adaptation in control but not mutant mice. These findings demonstrate that the mHb\textendash IPN pathway plays a crucial role in inhibitory control and cognition-dependent executive functions.},

High BMR mice had bigger guts, but not brains. Yet, they performed better in cognitively demanding tasks and had higher neuronal plasticity than their counterparts.

  abstract = {It is about half a century ago when the so-called ``Wise model'' to study alcohol drinking behavior in rats was established. The model was based on voluntary intermittent access to increasing concentrations of alcohol. We aimed to establish a model of alcohol craving and used an extinction test on withdrawal days 1 and 10 to study motivation for alcohol. For this purpose, the alcohol drinking training was paired with light cues to establish conditioning. The extinction test was carried out without alcohol but in the presence of light cues and empty bottles. The outcome measures were number of visits, nosepokes, and licks in the conditioned corner where the number of nosepokes represents how much mice ``want'' alcohol and number of licks shows how much mice ``like'' alcohol. The number of nosepokes during withdrawal is a measure of craving. Late withdrawal craving was found when intermittent alcohol access was carried out in the automated cages. In this case, we observed a significant increase in the number of nosepokes on both withdrawal days 1 and 10 as compared to water control. The number of nosepokes in the withdrawal days did not correlate with alcohol dose, but number of nosepokes on withdrawal day 1 correlated with the number of nosepokes on the last training day. Although we did not observe incubation of alcohol craving after withdrawal, the craving was increased at the late time point. We conclude that we have established a new tool to study alcohol drinking behavior and craving in female mice.},

  abstract = {Models of Tau pathology related to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are essential to determine underlying neurodegenerative pathologies and resulting tauopathy relevant behavioural changes. However, existing models are often limited in their translational value due to Tau overexpression, and the frequent occurrence of motor deficits which prevent comprehensive behavioural assessments. In order to address these limitations, a forebrainspecific (CaMKII{$\alpha$} promoter), human mutated Tau (hTauP301L + R406W) knock-in mouse was generated out of the previously characterised PLB1Triple mouse, and named PLB2Tau. After confirmation of an additional hTau species (\textasciitilde 60 kDa) in forebrain samples, we identified age-dependent progressive Tau phosphorylation which coincided with the emergence of FTD relevant behavioural traits. In line with the non-cognitive symptomatology of FTD, PLB2Tau mice demonstrated early emerging (\textasciitilde 6 months) phenotypes of heightened anxiety in the elevated plus maze, depressive/apathetic behaviour in a sucrose preference test and generally reduced exploratory activity in the absence of motor impairments. Investigations of cognitive performance indicated prominent dysfunctions in semantic memory, as assessed by social transmission of food preference, and in behavioural flexibility during spatial reversal learning in a home cage corner-learning task. Spatial learning was only mildly affected and task-specific, with impairments at 12 months of age in the corner learning but not in the water maze task. Electroencephalographic (EEG) investigations indicated a vigilance-stage specific loss of alpha power during wakefulness at both parietal and prefrontal recording sites, and site-specific EEG changes during non-rapid eye movement sleep (prefrontal) and rapid eye movement sleep (parietal). Further investigation of hippocampal electrophysiology conducted in slice preparations indicated a modest reduction in efficacy of synaptic transmission in the absence of altered synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {The between-laboratory effects on behavioral phenotypes and spatial learning performance of three strains of laboratory mice known for divergent behavioral phenotypes were evaluated in a fully balanced and synchronized study using a completely automated behavioral phenotyping device (IntelliCage). Activity pattern and spatial conditioning performance differed consistently between strains, i.e. exhibited no interaction with the between-laboratory factor, whereas the gross laboratory effect showed up significantly in the majority of measures. It is argued that overall differences between laboratories may not realistically be preventable, as subtle differences in animal housing and treatment will not be controllable, in practice. However, consistency of strain (or treatment) effects appears to be far more important in behavioral and brain sciences than the absolute overall level of such measures. In this respect, basic behavioral and learning measures proved to be highly consistent in the IntelliCage, therefore providing a valid basis for meaningful research hypothesis testing. Also, potential heterogeneity of behavioral status because of environmental and social enrichment has no detectable negative effect on the consistency of strain effects. We suggest that the absence of human interference during behavioral testing is the most prominent advantage of the IntelliCage and suspect that this is likely responsible for the between-laboratory consistency of findings, although we are aware that this ultimately needs direct testing.},

Here we found, using immunohistochemistry of wild-type and CD73 deficient mice, that CD73 is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia core comprised of striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and globus pallidus. Furthermore, meninges and the olfactory tubercle were found to specifically express CD73. Analysis of wild type (wt) and CD73 deficient mice revealed that CD73 confers the majority of 5'-nucleotidase activity in several areas of the brain. In a battery of behavioural tests and in IntelliCage studies, the CD73 deficient mice demonstrated significantly enhanced exploratory locomotor activity, which probably reflects the prominent expression of CD73 in striatum and globus pallidus that are known to control locomotion. Furthermore, the CD73 deficient mice displayed altered social behaviour. Overall, our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into adenosinergic signalling in brain, which is implicated in the regulation of normal and pathological behaviour.},

  abstract = {Several behavioral interventions, based on social enrichment and observational learning are applied in treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanism of such modulatory effect and the safety of applied methods on individuals involved in social support need further investigation. We took advantage of known differences between inbred mouse strains to reveal the effect of social enrichment on behavior and neurobiology of animals with different behavioral phenotypes. C57BL/6 and DBA/2 female mice displaying multiple differences in cognitive, social, and emotional behavior were group-housed either in same-strain or in mixed-strain conditions. Comprehensive behavioral phenotyping and analysis of expression of several plasticity- and stress-related genes were done to measure the reciprocal effects of social interaction between the strains. Contrary to our expectation, mixed housing did not change the behavior of DBA/2 mice. Nevertheless, the level of serum corticosterone and the expression of glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 in the brain were increased in mixed housed DBA/2 as compared with those of separately housed DBA/2 mice. In contrast, socially active C57BL/6 animals were more sensitive to the mixed housing, displaying several signs of stress: alterations in learning, social, and anxiety-like behavior and anhedonia. These behavioral impairments were accompanied by the elevated serum corticosterone and the reduced expression of Nr3c1, as well as the elevated Bdnf levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Our results demonstrate the importance of social factors in modulation of both behavior and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms in stress response, and draw attention to the potential negative impact of social interventions for individuals involved in social support.},

Using RNA-sequencing, we have quantified microRNA expression in four brain regions and liver, at three different ages, from an allelic series of HD model mice with increasing CAG length in the endogenous Huntingtin gene. Our analyses reveal CAG length-dependent microRNA expression changes in brain, with 159 microRNAs selectively altered in striatum, 102 in cerebellum, 51 in hippocampus, and 45 in cortex. In contrast, a progressive CAG length-dependent microRNA dysregulation was not observed in liver. We further identify microRNAs whose transcriptomic response to CAG length expansion differs significantly among the brain regions and validate our findings in data from a second, independent cohort of mice. Using existing mRNA expression data from the same animals, we assess the possible relationships between microRNA and mRNA expression and highlight candidate microRNAs that are negatively correlated with, and whose predicted targets are enriched in, CAG-length dependent mRNA modules. Several of our top microRNAs (Mir212/Mir132, Mir218, Mir128 and others) have been previously associated with aspects of neuronal development and survival. This study provides an extensive resource for CAG length-dependent changes in microRNA expression in diseasevulnerable and -resistant brain regions in HD mice, and provides new insights for further investigation of microRNAs in HD pathogenesis and therapeutics.},

Although cAMP-GEF II is expressed abundantly in several brain areas including the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, its specific function and possible role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes remain elusive. Here, we investigated how cAMP-GEF II affects synaptic function and animal behavior using cAMP-GEF II knockout mice. Results: We found that deletion of cAMP-GEF II induced moderate decrease in long-term potentiation, although this decrease was not statistically significant. On the other hand, it produced a significant and clear impairment in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of hippocampus, while microscopic morphology, basal synaptic transmission, and depotentiation were normal. Behavioral testing using the Morris water maze and automated IntelliCage system showed that cAMP-GEF II deficient mice had moderately reduced behavioral flexibility in spatial learning and memory. Conclusions: We concluded that cAMP-GEF II plays a key role in hippocampal functions including behavioral flexibility in reversal learning and in mechanisms underlying induction of long-term depression.},

This is partially due to uncontrollable interactions between experimenter, variations of experimental set-up and variable stress reactions of mice being exposed singly to a variety of stimuli and situations. Here we compare mice that have been raised under identical conditions but then tested in two different laboratories for exploratory behavior and spatial learning, first by manual testing using identical test set-ups, and then in the automated INTELLICAGE. The data presented here illustrate that automated testing provides much more consistent data across laboratories, and they show that INTELLICAGE measures at least partially the same behavioral traits as observed in standard tests of mouse exploratory behavior and spatial learning.},

  abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a condition characterised by the infiltration of leukocytes into the gastrointestinal wall. Leukocyte-MPO catalyses hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) formation from chloride (Cl-) and thiocyanous (SCN-) anions, respectively. While HOCl indiscriminately oxidises biomolecules, HOSCN primarily targets low-molecular weight protein thiols. Oxidative damage mediated by HOSCN may be reversible, potentially decreasing MPO-associated host tissue destruction. This study investigated the effect of SCN- supplementation in a model of acute colitis. Female mice were supplemented dextran sodium sulphate (DSS, 3\% w/v) in the presence of 10 mM Cl- or SCN- in drinking water ad libitum, or with salts (NaCl and NaSCN only) or water only (controls). Behavioural studies showed mice tolerated NaSCN and NaCl-treated water with water-seeking frequency. Ion-exchange chromatography showed increased fecal and plasma SCN- levels in thiocyanate supplemented mice; plasma SCN- reached similar fold-increase for smokers. Overall there was no difference in weight loss and clinical score, mucin levels, crypt integrity and extent of cellular infiltration between DSS/SCN- and DSS/Cl- groups. Neutrophil recruitment remained unchanged in DSS-treated mice, as assessed by fecal calprotectin levels. Total thiol and tyrosine phosphatase activity remained unchanged between DSS/Cl- and DSS/SCN- groups, however, colonic tissue showed a trend in decreased 3-chlorotyrosine (1.5-fold reduction, p {$<$} 0.051) and marked increase in colonic GCLC, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. These data suggest that SCN- administration can modulate MPO activity towards a HOSCN-specific pathway, however, this does not alter the development of colitis within a DSS murine model.},

This study, therefore, was designed to evaluate the effects of haloperidol on the learning performance of mice using an automated home cage environment, the IntelliCage. Behavioural shuttling in the IntelliCage enabled us to assess learning in tasks including place discrimination learning and reversal place learning. In reversal place learning, spatial patterns of rewarded and non-rewarded places that mice had learned to discriminate were reversed, and the adaptability of mice to change the previously acquired place learning was measured. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg/day) reduced locomotor activity and water intake. Haloperidol impaired the cognitive flexibility of mice during reversal place learning rewarded by access to water but enhanced the rapid acquisition of behavioural flexibility when airpuff punishment was applied.},

(R)-fluoxetine also increased cell proliferation in the hippocampus, in particular in the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus. (R)-fluoxetine had superior effects to (S)-fluoxetine in elevated plus maze, forced-swim and tail-suspension tests. These results suggest that (R)fluoxetine, which has been reported to have a shorter half-life than (S)-fluoxetine, has superior antidepressant effects and more consistently improves spatial learning and memory. This profile offers advantages in depression treatment and may also aid management of the neurocognitive impairments associated with depression.},

Genetically modified mouse models of cognitive decline, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have become a promising tool to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and promote the therapeutic advances. An important step is the validation and characterization of expected behavioral abnormality in the models, in the case of AD, cognitive decline. The long-term behavioral investigations of laboratory animals to study the effect of aging demand substantial efforts from researchers. The IntelliCage system is a high-throughput and cost-effective test battery for mice that eliminates the need for daily human handling. Here, we describe how the system is utilized in the long-term phenotyping of a genetic Alzheimer's disease model, specifically focusing on the cognitive functions. The experiment employs repeated battery of tests that assess spatial learning and executive functions. This cost-effective agedependent phenotyping allows us to identify the transient and/or permanent effects of genes on various cognitive aspects.},

To overcome this issue, mice with single humanized App knock-in (KI) carrying Swedish (NL), Beyreuther/Iberian (F), and Arctic (G) mutations in different combinations were recently developed. The validity of these mouse models of AD from a behavioral viewpoint, however, has not been extensively evaluated. Thus, using an automated behavior monitoring system, we analyzed various behavioral domains, including executive function, and learning and memory. The App-KI mice carrying NL-G-F mutations showed clear deficits in spatial memory and flexible learning, enhanced compulsive behavior, and reduced attention performance. Mice carrying NL-F mutations exhibited modest abnormalities. The NL-G-F mice had a greater and more rapid accumulation of Ab deposits and glial responses. These findings reveal that single pathologic App-KI is sufficient to produce deficits in broad cognitive domains and that App-KI mouse lines with different levels of pathophysiology are useful models of AD.},

Astrocyte-specific deletion of Tcf7l2 in the early postnatal period led to alterations in astrocyte morphology, membrane depolarization and decreased cortical neuron excitability. Mice with the conditional knockout exhibited increased sociability and social preference in a naturalistic setting. Taken together, these data reveal a key role of astrocytic Wnt signaling in shaping postnatal neuronal development and adult social behavior.},

No differences were observed either in circadian activity or in performance in the novelty-induced exploration test, but middle-aged mice exhibited decreased exploratory activity overall. In the place learning test module, when mice were free to explore all corners without any negative reinforcement, young mice tended not to learn the task and performed less effectively than the middle-aged group. However, when an air-puff was administered as negative reinforcement following visits to an incorrect corner, young mice learned the task significantly better than middle-aged mice throughout the test period. Our data show that, in freely moving mice, the motivational cues for learning and retrieval of memory are age-dependent and dramatically influence learning and memory performance. Furthermore, the data reported here represent a step towards optimised cognitive test protocols when comparing young and middle-aged mice.},

Previous studies had indicated important synaptic functions of APP and the closely related homologue APLP2 in excitatory forebrain neurons for spine density, synaptic plasticity, and behavior. Here, we show that APP is also widely expressed in several interneuron subtypes, both in hippocampus and cortex. To address the functional role of APP in inhibitory neurons, we generated mice with a conditional APP/APLP2 double knockout (cDKO) in GABAergic forebrain neurons using DlxCre mice. These DlxCre cDKO mice exhibit cognitive deficits in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory tasks, as well as impairments in species-typic nesting and burrowing behaviors. Deficits at the behavioral level were associated with altered neuronal morphology and synaptic plasticity Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). Impaired basal synaptic transmission at the Schafer collateral/CA1 pathway, which was associated with altered compound excitatory/inhibitory synaptic currents and reduced action potential firing of CA1 pyramidal cells, points to a disrupted excitation/inhibition balance in DlxCre cDKOs. Together, these impairments may lead to hippocampal dysfunction. Collectively, our data reveal a crucial role of APP family proteins in inhibitory interneurons to maintain functional network activity.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive and psychiatric manifestations. Since the mutation responsible for the disease was identified as an unstable expansion of CAG repeats in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein in 1993, numerous mouse models of HD have been generated to study disease pathogenesis and evaluate potential therapeutic approaches. Of these, knock-in models best mimic the human condition from a genetic perspective since they express the mutation in the appropriate genetic and protein context. Behaviorally, however, while some abnormal phenotypes have been detected in knock-in mouse models, a model with an earlier and more robust phenotype than the existing models is required. We describe here for the first time a new mouse line, the zQ175 knock-in mouse, derived from a spontaneous expansion of the CAG copy number in our CAG 140 knock-in colony [1]. Given the inverse relationship typically observed between age of HD onset and length of CAG repeat, since this new mouse line carries a significantly higher CAG repeat length it was expected to be more significantly impaired than the parent line. Using a battery of behavioral tests we evaluated both heterozygous and homozygous zQ175 mice. Homozygous mice showed motor and grip strength abnormalities with an early onset (8 and 4 weeks of age, respectively), which were followed by deficits in rotarod and climbing activity at 30 weeks of age and by cognitive deficits at around 1 year of age. Of particular interest for translational work, we also found clear behavioral deficits in heterozygous mice from around 4.5 months of age, especially in the dark phase of the diurnal cycle. Decreased body weight was observed in both heterozygotes and homozygotes, along with significantly reduced survival in the homozygotes. In addition, we detected an early and significant decrease of striatal gene markers from 12 weeks of age. These data suggest that the zQ175 knock-in line could be a suitable model for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches and early events in the pathogenesis of HD.},

Furthermore, beneficial effects have been reported from the genetic ablation of TG2 in R6/2 and R6/1 mouse lines. To further evaluate the validity of this target for the treatment of HD, we examined the effects of TG2 deletion in two genetic mouse models of HD: R6/2 CAG 240 and zQ175 knock in (KI). Contrary to previous reports, under rigorous experimental conditions we found that TG2 ablation had no effect on either motor or cognitive deficits, or on the weight loss. In addition, under optimal husbandry conditions, TG2 ablation did not extend R6/2 lifespan. Moreover, TG2 deletion did not change the huntingtin aggregate load in cortex or striatum and did not decrease the brain atrophy observed in either mouse line. Finally, no amelioration of the dysregulation of striatal and cortical gene markers was detected. We conclude that TG2 is not a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of HD.},

The role of this autophosphorylation in the regulation of addiction-related behaviors has been proposed but is still poorly understood. Here, using {$\alpha$}CaMKII autophosphorylation-deficient mutant mice (T286A), we show that, in comparison with wild-type animals, they are less resistant to high doses of alcohol and do not show psychostimulant response neither to alcohol injections nor during voluntary alcohol drinking. T286A mutants are also less prone to develop alcohol addiction-related behaviors including an increased motivation for alcohol, persistent alcohol seeking during withdrawal and alcohol consumption on relapse. Finally, we demonstrate that {$\alpha$}CaMKII autophosphorylation regulates also alcohol-induced remodeling of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus and amygdala. In conclusion, our data suggest that {$\alpha$}CaMKII autophosphorylation-dependent remodeling of glutamatergic synapses is a plausible mechanism for the regulation of the alcohol addiction-related behaviors.},

However, the role of these brain immune cells in mediating the effects of stress is still unclear. Fractalkine signaling \textendash{} which comprises the chemokine CX3CL1, mainly expressed by neurons, and its receptor CX3CR1, almost exclusively present on microglia in the healthy brain \textendash{} has been reported to critically regulate microglial activity. Here, we investigated whether interfering with microglial function by deleting the Cx3cr1 gene affects the brain's response to chronic stress. To this purpose, we housed Cx3cr1 knockout and wild-type adult mice in either control or stressful environments for 2 weeks, and investigated the consequences on microglial phenotype and interactions with synapses, synaptic transmission, behavioral response and corticosterone levels. Our results show that hampering neuron\textendash microglia communication via the CX3CR1\textendash CX3CL1 pathway prevents the effects of chronic unpredictable stress on microglial function, short- and long-term neuronal plasticity and depressive-like behavior. Overall, the present findings suggest that microglia-regulated mechanisms may underlie the differential susceptibility to stress and consequently the vulnerability to diseases triggered by the experience of stressful events, such as major depression.},

  abstract = {The {$\alpha$}9{$\alpha$}10-subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has recently garnered interest in biomedicine and is being pursued as an analgesic target. However, the receptor exhibits diverse tissue distribution, the function of which is known to varying degrees, and targeting this receptor for clinical treatments without a broad understanding of its function may have adverse consequences. The {$\alpha$}9{$\alpha$}10-nAChR is expressed in the adrenal and pituitary glands, suggesting a potential role in the stress response, but little is known about its function in this tissue. Here we determined a role for the {$\alpha$}9{$\alpha$}10-nAChR in behavioural and physiological stress responses, by comparing the stress- and affect-related phenotypes of wildtype and {$\alpha$}9-nAChR knockout mice. Na\"ive knockout mice exhibited largely normal behaviour on standard tests of affective behaviour. However, after sub-chronic restraint stress knockout mice showed significantly decreased stress-induced arousal and increased anxiety-like behaviour when compared to wildtype animals. Physiologically, corticosterone responses were muted in knockout mice after an acute stressor, but exaggerated in response to the same stressor after undergoing subchronic stress. Behavioural profiling of the {$\alpha$}9-nAChR knockout mice in the home-cage revealed that circadian patterns of activity were altered when compared to wildtype controls. Furthermore, knockout mice showed altered responses to a period of reward discounting, resulting in anhedonia-like behaviour in a sucrose preference test where WT mice continued to seek reward. These experiments uncover a novel role for the {$\alpha$}9{$\alpha$}10nAChR in mounting a normal stress response and in the regulation of affective- and reward-related behaviour, and suggest that pursuing the receptor for clinical treatments may not be as straightforward as has been suggested.},

However, no study has thoroughly investigated the locomotion and morphological changes in animals after IntelliCage Exposure (IE). Therefore, to elucidate the locomotive activity and morphological changes in striatum of mice models of fluid percussion injury (FPI), we designed a novel strategy and utilised an advanced neurobehavioral monitoring device known as the IE system. We observed locomotive functioning, from the induction of injury until complete recovery. To achieve the objectives, mice were divided into four groups, the (i) sham group (n = 8), (ii) FPI group (n = 8), and not subjected to acclimatisation in the IE, (iii) sham group (n = 11) and (iv) FPI group (n = 11), and subjected to acclimatisation in the IE. Locomotive activity was monitored for each group for 5 days. Results suggested that the neuronal damage associated with locomotive impairment could occur in the early hours (3\textendash 6 h) post-FPI. The process of recovery started significantly at 24 h and continued. Results showed a complete restoration in locomotive activity by the FPI mice at 72 h post-trauma. Morphological results suggested that FPI mice with IE showed less dead cells as compared to FPI mice without IE. Our data also suggested a new dimension for the factors influencing FPI recovery.

For years, researchers in this field have discussed the apparent detrimental effects of the endogenous amino acid homocysteine in the brain. In this study, the roles of hyperhomocysteinemia driven by vitamin B deficiency, as well as potentially beneficial dietary interventions, were investigated in the novel AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse model for AD, simulating an early stage of the disease. Methods: Urine and serum samples were analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method and the impact of different experimental diets on cognitive performance was studied in a comprehensive behavioral test battery. Finally, we analyzed brain samples immunohistochemically in order to assess amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) plaque deposition. Results: Behavioral testing data indicated subtle cognitive deficits in AppNL-G-F compared to C57BL/6J wild type mice. Elevation of homocysteine and homocysteic acid, as well as counteracting dietary interventions, mostly did not result in significant effects on learning and memory performance, nor in a modified A{$\beta$} plaque deposition in 35-week-old AppNL-G-F mice. Conclusion: Despite prominent A{$\beta$} plaque deposition, the AppNL-G-F model merely displays a very mild AD-like phenotype at the investigated age. Older AppNL-G-F mice should be tested in order to further investigate potential effects of hyperhomocysteinemia and dietary interventions.},

These deficits are not due to gross motor dysfunction in the test animals, but instead appear to measure some inability to inhibit responding in the HD mouse models, suggesting this assay may measure deficits in underlying attentional and/or behavioral inhibition processes. Accordingly, this assay may be well suited to evaluation of simple deficits in cognitive function in mouse HD models, providing a potential platform for preclinical screening.},

At around P14\textendash 16W, NE, GABA and Glu levels in nine brain regions were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, the associations between the neurotransmitter levels and the behavioral indices were statistically analyzed. Results: In females exposed to BPA, the GABA and Glu levels in almost all regions, and the NE levels in the cortex, hypothalamus and thalamus were higher than those in the controls. In males exposed to BPA, the GABA levels in the amygdala and hippocampus showed lower values, while Glu levels were higher in some regions, compared with the controls. In regard to the associations, the number of ``diurnal corner visits without drinking'' was correlated with the NE levels in the cortex and thalamus in females. The ``nocturnal corner visit duration without drinking'' was correlated with the GABA level in the hippocampus in males.

Rat milk contains Sia, which peaks at Postnatal Day 9 and drops to a minimum by Day 15. To bypass this Sia peak, a cohort of foster mothers was used to raise the experimental pups. A group of pups received a daily oral supplementation of Neu5Ac to mimic the amount naturally present in rat milk, and another group received the same molar amount of Sia as 6 -SL. The control group received water. After weaning, rats were submitted to behavioral evaluation. One year later, behavior was re-evaluated, and in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) was performed. Brain samples were collected and analyzed at both ages. Adult rats who received Sia performed significantly better in the behavioral assessment and showed an enhanced LTP compared to controls. Within Sia groups, 6 -SL rats showed better scores in some cognitive outcomes compared to Neu5Ac rats. At weaning, an effect on polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) levels in the frontal cortex was only observed in 6 -SL fed rats.

  abstract = {Ohtahara syndrome, also known as type 4 of Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy with suppression bursts (EIEE-4) is currently an untreatable disorder that presents with seizures and impaired cognition. EIEE-4 patients have mutations most frequently in the STXBP1 gene encoding a Sec protein, munc18-1. The exact molecular mechanism of how these munc18-1 mutations cause impaired cognition, remains elusive. The leading haploinsufficiency hypothesis posits that mutations in munc18-1 render the protein unstable leading to its degradation. Expression driven by the healthy allele is not sufficient to maintain the physiological function resulting in haploinsufficiency. The aim of this study has been to understand how munc18-1 haploinsufficiency causes cognitive impairment seen in EIEE-4. Here we present results from behavioral to cellular effects from a mouse model of munc18-1 haploinsufficiency. Munc18-1 heterozygous knock-out mice showed impaired spatial learning and memory in behavior tests as well as reduced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation. Cultured munc18-1 heterozygous hippocampal neurons had significantly slower rate of synaptic vesicle release and decreased readily releasable vesicle pool compared to wild-type control neurons in fluorescent FM dye assays. These results demonstrate that reduced munc18-1 levels are sufficient to impair learning and memory by reducing neurotransmitter release. Therefore, our study implicates munc18-1 haploinsufficiency as a primary cause of cognitive impairment seen in EIEE-4 patients.},

This view has been challenged by the age-dependent seroprevalence (up to {$>$}20\%) of functional NMDAR1-AB of all immunoglobulin classes found in {$>$}5000 individuals, healthy or affected by different diseases. These findings question a merely encephalitogenic role of NMDAR1-AB. Here, we show that NMDAR1AB belong to the normal autoimmune repertoire of dogs, cats, rats, mice, baboons, and rhesus macaques, and are functional in the NMDAR1 internalization assay based on human IPSC-derived cortical neurons. The age dependence of seroprevalence is lost in nonhuman primates in captivity and in human migrants, raising the intriguing possibility that chronic life stress may be related to NMDAR1-AB formation, predominantly of the IgA class. Active immunization of ApoE-/- and ApoE+/+ mice against four peptides of the extracellular NMDAR1 domain or ovalbumin (control) leads to high circulating levels of specific AB. After 4 weeks, the endogenously formed NMDAR1-AB (IgG) induce psychosis-like symptoms upon MK-801 challenge in ApoE-/- mice, characterized by an open blood\textendash brain barrier, but not in their ApoE+/+ littermates, which are indistinguishable from ovalbumin controls. Importantly, NMDAR1-AB do not induce any sign of inflammation in the brain. Immunohistochemical staining for microglial activation markers and T lymphocytes in the hippocampus yields comparable results in ApoE-/- and ApoE+/+ mice, irrespective of immunization against NMDAR1 or ovalbumin. These data suggest that NMDAR1-AB of the IgG class shape behavioral phenotypes upon access to the brain but do not cause brain inflammation on their own.},

Here, we show that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling on dopaminoceptive neurons is necessary for both novelty-seeking behavior and the abstinence-induced escalation of alcohol drinking. Methods: Mice harboring a transgene expressing microRNA hairpins against mGluR5 messenger RNA under the control of the D1 dopamine receptor gene promoter (mGluR5KD-D1) were tested in a battery of behavioral tests measuring learning abilities, anxiety levels, reactions to novelty, operant sensation seeking, and alcohol sensitivity. In addition, we have developed a method to assess long-term patterns of alcohol drinking in mice housed in groups using the IntelliCage system. Results: mGluR5KD-D1 mice showed no behavioral deficits and exhibited normal anxiety-like behaviors and learning abilities. However, mGluR5KD-D1 animals showed reduced locomotor activity when placed in a novel environment, and exhibited decreased interaction with a novel object. Moreover, unlike control animals, mutant mice did not perform instrumental responses under the operant sensation-seeking paradigm, although they learned to respond for food normally. When mGluR5KD-D1 mice were provided access to alcohol, they showed similar patterns of consumption as wild-type animals. However, mutant mice did not escalate their alcohol consumption after a period of forced abstinence, but control mice almost doubled their intake. Conclusions: These data identify mGluR5 receptors on D1-expressing neurons as a common molecular substrate of novelty-seeking behaviors and behaviors associated with alcohol abuse.},

It is highly expressed in the salivary and mammary glands and secreted into saliva and milk. Although CA VI was first described as a gustatory protein, its exact functional roles have remained enigmatic. Interestingly, polymorphism of the CA6 gene was recently linked to bitter taste perception in humans. In this study, we compared the preference of Car6-/- and wild-type mice for different taste modalities in an IntelliCage monitoring environment. Morphologies of taste buds, tongue papillae, and von Ebner's glands were evaluated by light microscopy. Cell proliferation and rate of apoptosis in tongue specimens were examined by Ki67 immunostaining and fluorescent DNA fragmentation staining, respectively. Results: The behavioral follow up of the mice in an IntelliCage system revealed that Car6-/- mice preferred 3 {$\mu$}M quinine (bitter) solution, whereas wild type mice preferred water. When the quinine concentration increased, both groups preferentially selected water. Histological analysis, Ki67 immunostaining and detection of apoptosis did not reveal any significant changes between tongue specimens of the knockout and wild type mice. Conclusions: Our knockout mouse model confirms that CA VI is involved in bitter taste perception. CA VI may be one of the factors which contribute to avoidance of bitter, potentially harmful, substances.},

Visits, nosepokes, lick numbers and durations were recorded. Mice were then trained to distinguish between a rewarded correct corner and punished, incorrect corners. Later, in the reversal learning phase, the assigned correct corner was rotated clockwise every 24 h. Upon s.c. administration of scopolamine general activity represented by visit and nosepoke numbers increased, but their durations were shorter. Surprisingly, general activity and lick behavior were drastically altered. Scopolamine also significantly reduced the ability to perform a reversal learning task. We not only found significant decline in reversal learning due to scopolamine treatment, but studied the method specific underlying behaviors: the general activity and lick behavior as well.},

In the present study, we used mice lacking the third complement component (C3) to elucidate the role the complement system plays in hippocampus-dependent learning and synaptic function. We found that the constitutive absence of C3 is associated with enhanced place and reversal learning in adult mice. Our findings of lower release probability at CA3\textendash CA1 glutamatergic synapses in combination with unaltered overall efficacy of these synapses in C3 deficient mice implicate C3 as a negative regulator of the number of functional glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus. The C3 deficient mice showed no signs of spontaneous epileptiform activity in the hippocampus. We conclude that C3 plays a role in the regulation of the number and function of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus and exerts negative effects on hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance.},

  abstract = {The molecular alterations that underlie the long-lasting behavioural effects of drugs of abuse, such as psychomotor sensitization and physical dependence, are still not known. Moreover, it is not known which molecular effects are similar for addictive drugs from various pharmacological classes. In this study, we utilized wholegenome microarray profiling to evaluate the detailed time-course of transcriptional alterations in the mouse striatum during chronic treatment with heroin (HER) and methamphetamine (METH) and after period of spontaneous withdrawal. We identified 27 genes regulated by chronic drug administration. The overlap between lists of HER- and METH-induced genes was highly significant. The most substantial impact on the gene expression profile was observed for circadian genes (Per1, Per2 and Nr1d1). However, changing the treatment scheme from diurnal to nocturnal was sufficient to attenuate the drug-induced changes in circadian gene mRNA levels. Both of the drugs caused a dose-dependent induction in glucocorticoid-dependent genes with relatively long mRNA half-lives (Fkbp5, Sult1a1 and Plin4). The analysis also showed a drug-regulated group of transcripts enriched in the nucleus accumbens and includes well known (Pdyn, Cartpt and Rgs2) as well as new (Fam40b and Inmt) candidate genes. All identified alterations in the striatal transcriptome were transient and persisted up to 6 days after withdrawal. Behavioural sensitization, however, was maintained throughout the 12-day withdrawal period for both HER and METH. We suggest that transient gene expression alterations during drug treatment and in the early period of withdrawal are involved in the establishment of persistent neuroplastic alterations responsible for the development of drug addiction.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of studies show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) exert their therapeutic action, at least in part, by amplifying the influence of the living environment on mood. As a consequence, when administered in a favorable environment, SSRIs lead to a reduction of symptoms, but in stressful conditions, they show limited efficacy. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches able to neutralize the influence of the stressful environment on treatment are needed. The aim of our study was to test whether, in a mouse model of depression, the combined administration of SSRI fluoxetine and metformin, a drug able to improve the metabolic profile, counteracts the limited efficacy of fluoxetine alone when administered in stressful conditions. Indeed, metabolic alterations are associated to both the onset of major depression and the antidepressant efficacy. To this goal, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to stress for 6 weeks; the first two weeks was aimed at generating a mouse model of depression. During the remaining 4 weeks, mice received one of the following treatments: vehicle, fluoxetine, metformin, or a combination of fluoxetine and metformin. We measured liking- and wanting-type anhedonia as behavioral phenotypes of depression and assessed the expression levels of selected genes involved in major depressive disorder and antidepressant response in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, which are differently involved in the depressive symptomatology. The combined treatment was more effective than fluoxetine alone in ameliorating the depressive phenotype after one week of treatment. This was associated to an increase in IGF2 mRNA expression and enhanced long-term potentiation, specifically in the dorsal hippocampus, at the end of treatment. Overall, the present results show that, when administered in stressful conditions, the combined fluoxetine and metformin treatment may represent a more effective approach than fluoxetine alone in a short term. Finally, our findings highlight the relevance of polypharmacological strategy as effective interventions to increase the efficacy of the antidepressant drugs currently available.},

  abstract = {Repetitive behaviors are a key feature of many pervasive developmental disorders, such as autism. As a heterogeneous group of symptoms, repetitive behaviors are conceptualized into two main subgroups: sensory/motor (lower-order) and cognitive rigidity (higher-order). Although lower-order repetitive behaviors are measured in mouse models in several paradigms, so far there have been no high-throughput tests directly measuring cognitive rigidity. We describe a novel approach for monitoring repetitive behaviors during reversal learning in mice in the automated IntelliCage system. During the reward-motivated place preference reversal learning, designed to assess cognitive abilities of mice, visits to the previously rewarded places were recorded to measure cognitive flexibility. Thereafter, emotional flexibility was assessed by measuring conditioned fear extinction. Additionally, to look for neuronal correlates of cognitive impairments, we measured CA3-CA1 hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP). To standardize the designed tests we used C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, representing two genetic backgrounds, for induction of autism by prenatal exposure to the sodium valproate. We found impairments of place learning related to perseveration and no LTP impairments in C57BL/6 valproate-treated mice. In contrast, BALB/c valproate-treated mice displayed severe deficits of place learning not associated with perseverative behaviors and accompanied by hippocampal LTP impairments. Alterations of cognitive flexibility observed in C57BL/6 valproate-treated mice were related to neither restricted exploration pattern nor to emotional flexibility. Altogether, we showed that the designed tests of cognitive performance and perseverative behaviors are efficient and highly replicable. Moreover, the results suggest that genetic background is crucial for the behavioral effects of prenatal valproate treatment.},

  abstract = {Objective: To establish chronic sleep deprivation mouse model, evaluate the learning and memory ability of mice and observe autophagy and apoptosis levels in mouse brain. Methods: C57BL/6 mice (n=20) were randomly separated into sleep deprivation group and control group. After 2-month sleep deprivation by using an adapted multiple platform method, the behavioral performance of mice was measured by IntelliCage system. The expression of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Beclin-1 was detected by Western blotting. Confocol microscopy was used to observe autophagosome. In addition, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to detect neuronal apoptosis level in mouse brain. Results: The results of behavioral test showed that the incorrect visit ratio was much higher in sleep deprivation group than that in control group. Moreover, the expression of LC3-II(sleep deprivation group 1.681{$\pm$}0.186, control group 1.125{$\pm$}0.048, t=2.892, P=0.027 6) and Beclin-1(sleep deprivation group 1.144{$\pm$}0.048, control group 1.006{$\pm$}0.017, t=2.721, P=0.018 6) in mouse hippocampus and cortex was significantly elevated in sleep deprivation group than those in control group. Accordingly, the confocal microscopy observation also revealed an increased nuclear LC3-positive puncta in hippocampus and cortex of sleep deprived mice (hippocampus in sleep deprivation group 1.665{$\pm$}0.153, in control group 0.819{$\pm$}0.072, t=5.024, P=0.002 4; cortex in sleep deprivation group 1.925{$\pm$}0.175, in control group 1.195{$\pm$}0.111, t=3.521, P=0.012 5). In addition, TUNEL staining showed a much higher percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei in these brain regions (hippocampus in sleep deprivation group 47.24{$\pm$}4.15, in control group 19.26{$\pm$}3.72, t=5.025, P=0.007 4; cortex in sleep deprivation group 42.25{$\pm$}1.25, in control group 27.50{$\pm$}3.23, t=4.262, P=0.005 3). Conclusions: Chronic sleep deprivation can impair the learning and memory, increase the expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1, elevate the formation of autophagosome, and promote apoptosis in mouse brain. These findings suggest that autophagy and apoptosis might be involved in the cognitive impairment induced by chronic sleep deprivation.},

On the level of cellular signaling, regulator of G protein signaling 2 (Rgs2) has been implicated in human and rodent anxiety. However, there is limited knowledge about the role of Rgs2 in fear learning and reactivity to stress. In this study, Rgs2-/- mice showed increased fear learning, male mice displayed increased contextual and cued fear learning, while females showed selectively enhanced cued fear learning. Male Rgs2-/- mice displayed increased long-term-contextual fear memory, but increased cued fear extinction. Learning in spatial non-aversive paradigms was also increased in Rgs2-/- mice. Female, but not male mice show increased spatial learning in the Barnes maze, while male mice showed enhanced place preference in the IntelliCage, rendering enhanced cognitive function non-specific for aversive stimuli. Consistent with the previous results, Rgs2 deletion resulted in increased innate anxiety, including neophobic behavior expressed as hypolocomotion, in three different tests based on the approach-avoidance conflict. Acute electric foot shock stress provoked hypolocomotion in several exploration-based tests, suggesting fear generalization in both genotypes. Rgs2 deletion was associated with reduced monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and disturbed corresponding GPCR expression of the adrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and neuropeptide Y system. Taken together, Rgs2 deletion promotes improved cognitive function as well as increased anxiety-like behavior, but has no effect on acute stress reactivity. These effects may be related to the observed disruption of the monoaminergic systems.},

Unclear, however, is whether the same phenotypes can be observed in laboratory animals prone to uncontrolled alcohol drinking. To characterize a novelty-seeking trait, anxiety, impulsivity, compulsivity and the motivation for natural rewards in mice, numerous tests were performed in the automated IntelliCage learning system. The same mice then had extended access to alcohol for 70 days, followed by the evaluation of addiction-like behaviors, including (1) the motivation for alcohol in a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement; (2) persistent and compulsive alcohol seeking and taking during signaled `no alcohol' periods and (3) when subjected to punishment; and (4) the intensity of relapse after alcohol withdrawal. Our data suggest that high levels of anxiety-related traits (i.e. low novelty seeking, low resistance to punishment and a high level of compulsive behaviors) and high impulsivity predict addiction-like alcohol drinking in mice. Future studies are, however, warranted to create a valid model of alcohol addiction in mice in the IntelliCage system.},

New method: This study assessed the effectiveness of three different observation systems as methods for determining strain and pharmacological induced differences in locomotor activity, feeding behaviour and spatial learning. The effect of the CB1 antagonist AM251 on feeding behaviour was determined in the PhenoMaster and PhenoTyper. Next, effects of cholinergic (scopolamine) and glutamatergic (Phenylcyclidine, PCP) receptor antagonism and dopaminergic agonism (apomorphine) on activity were assessed in the PhenoTyper and IntelliCage. Finally, the IntelliCage was utilised to determine differences in activity and spatial learning of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse strains following pharmacological intervention. Results: AM251 induced a suppression of food intake, feeding behaviour and a reduction in body weight in both the PhenoTyper and PhenoMaster. Apomorphine reduced activity in both the PhenoTyper and IntelliCage. Whereas, decreased activity was evident with PCP in the PhenoTyper, but not IntelliCage and Scopolamine induced a trend towards elevated levels of activity in the IntelliCage but not PhenoTyper. Strain differences in activity and spatial learning were also evident, with increased corner visits and drug induced impairments only observed with C57BL/6 mice. Comparison with existing method: The automated home cage observation systems determined similar drug and strain effects on behaviour to those observed using traditional methods. Conclusions: All three observation systems reported drug-induced changes in behaviour however, they differ in their application of spatial learning tasks and utilisation of single versus group housed recordings.},

However in addition, PV is expressed by excitatory, glutamatergic neurons in various areas of the brain and spinal cord. Depending on the location of these neurons, loading of their synaptic vesicles with glutamate is mediated by either of three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGlut): VGlut1, VGlut2, or VGlut3. Driven by our interest in one of these glutamatergic/PV-expressing cell clusters\textemdash the lateral hypothalamic parvafox nucleus\textemdash we investigated the functions of this population of neurons by the selective deletion of VGlut2 expression in PV-expressing cells according to the Cre/Lox-approach. PV-Cre;VGlut2-Lox mutant mice are phenotypically characterized by deficits in locomotion and vocalization, by a decreased thermal nociception, and by an increased social dominance. We conducted a search of the Allen Brain Atlas for regions that might co-express the genes encoding PV and VGlut2, and that might thus contribute to the manifestation of the observed phenotypes. Our survey revealed several structures that could contribute to the deficits in locomotion and vocalization, such as the red, the subthalamic and the deep cerebellar nuclei. It also disclosed that a shift in the balance of afferental glutamatergic neurotransmission to the periaqueductal gray matter might be accountable for the decrease in sensitivity to pain and for the increase in social dominance. As a whole, this study broadens the state of knowledge about PV-expressing excitatory neurons.},

However, most experimental studies are performed on male animals only. Our aim was to investigate possible long-term gender differences in response to cranial irradiation (IR). Basal neurogenesis in non-irradiated mice was higher in females but this was not apparent until the animals were adult. Male and female C57BL {$\fracslash$} 6J mice received a single dose of 8 Gy to the whole brain on postnatal day 14 and were killed 6 h or 4 months later. Proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, as judged by the number of phosphohistone H3-positive cells, was reduced by half 6 h after IR in both males and females. The reduced proliferation was still obvious 4 months after IR. Consequently, the continuous addition of new neurons to the granule cell layer (GCL) during brain growth was reduced in irradiated mice, and the reduction was more pronounced in females. This resulted in hampered growth of the GCL, reduced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in adulthood, and severely reduced adult neurogenesis, as judged by the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the GCL. In an open-field test, locomotor activity was increased in both males and females after IR and anxiety levels were increased, more so in females. In an IntelliCage test, place learning was impaired by IR in females but not males.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder, for which no known cure or effective treatment exists. To facilitate the search for new potential treatments of HD, an automated system for analyzing the behavior of transgenic HD mice is urgently needed. A recently developed behavior screening system, the IntelliCage, allows automated testing of mouse behavior in the home cage employing individual recognition of animals living in social groups. The present study validates the ability of the IntelliCage system to detect behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in R6/2 mice, an established transgenic model of HD. The results indicate that the IntelliCage is a reliable system for recording exploratory activity, drinking behavior, circadian rhythm, spatial preference, and cognition in mice during prolonged periods of assessment. The system detected early dysfunctional behaviors in R6/2 mice, such as decrease in exploratory activity, sleep disturbances, increased drinking, and repetitive behavior. Additionally, the use of various learning tasks, such as spatial avoidance and spatial patrolling, revealed early cognitive changes in R6/2 mice. The simple learning tasks may be used at both early and late stages of the disease.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a heritable neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by metabolic disturbances, along with cognitive and psychiatric impairments. Targeting metabolic HD dysfunction via the maintenance of body weight and fat mass and restoration of peripheral energy metabolism can improve the progression of neurological symptoms. In this respect, we focused on the therapeutic potential of the orexigenic peptide hormone ghrelin, which plays an important role in promoting a positive energy balance. In the present study, we found a significant disruption of circadian metabolic regulation in a R6/2 mouse HD model in the late stage of disease. Daily circadian rhythms of activity, energy expenditure, respiratory exchange ratio and feeding were strongly attenuated in R6/2 mice. During the rest phase, R6/2 mice had a higher total activity, elevated energy expenditure and excessive water consumption compared to control mice. We also found that, in the late stage of disease, R6/2 mice had ghrelin axis deficiency as a result of low circulating ghrelin levels, in addition to down-regulation of the ghrelin receptor and several key signalling molecules in the hypothalamus, as well as a reduced responsiveness to exogenous peripheral ghrelin. We demonstrated that, in pre-symptomatic mice, responsiveness to ghrelin is preserved. Chronic ghrelin treatment efficiently increased lean body mass and decreased the energy expenditure and fat utilisation of R6/2 mice in the early stage of disease. In addition, ghrelin treatment was also effective in the normalisation of drinking behaviour and the rest activity of these mice. Ghrelin treatment could provide a novel therapeutic possibility for delaying disease progression; however, deficiency in ghrelin receptor expression could limit its therapeutic potential in the late stage of disease.},

Pharmacological manipulations of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)- or D2R-dependent pathways in these animals reveal altered responses to D1- and D2-MSN-mediated control of motor output. These findings reveal a critical role for FTO to control D2 MSN excitability, their projections to the GPe, and behavioral responses to novelty.},

  abstract = {Anxiety disorders are the most common forms of mental illness of the adult population of the U.S.A. Use of animal models for anxiety has made an important contribution to clinical and pharmacological anxiety research as well as basic research of the mechanisms involved. We review the current operant conditioning models that are used in anxiety research as well as paradigms using unconditioned fear responses. We then outline how they could theoretically and in practice be adapted to the settings of a novel automated system, the IntelliCage. The IntelliCage is a computer-controlled environment for socially housed mice that automatically records a number of behavioral parameters for each mouse and in addition allows to individually condition and test mice. IntelliCage allows fast and efficient test procedures for evaluating fear responses with a minimum of handling stress and a maximum of standardization. To confirm suitability of the IntelliCage for the study of anxiety, we present results on a modified Vogel water-lick conflict for mice. After 18 hours of water deprivation, mice were exposed to the following three conditions: punished drinking, punished drinking after injection of Diazepam, and punished drinking after injection of saline. The IntelliCage automatically quantified and recorded behavioral parameters indicative of anxiety for each individual. None of the parameters differed between untreated and saline treated control mice. In contrast, animals treated with Diazepam significantly differed from the two other groups in several aspects indicative of decreased anxiety elicited by the aversive stimulus. The results were robust and remained unchanged after correction for individual differences and drug-induced differences in activity. Our study shows that the IntelliCage can be used to assess anxiety and anxiolytic drug effects in a fast and efficient way.},

  abstract = {Neonicotinoids, a widely used group of pesticides designed to selectively bind to insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, were considered relatively safe for mammalian species. However, they have been found to activate vertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and could be toxic to the mammalian brain. In the present study, we evaluated the developmental neurotoxicity of acetamiprid (ACE), one of the most widely used neonicotinoids, in C57BL/6J mice whose mothers were administered ACE via gavage at doses of either 0 mg/kg (control group), 1.0 mg/kg (low-dose group), or 10.0 mg/kg (high-dose group) from gestational day 6 to lactation day 21. The results of a battery of behavior tests for socio-sexual and anxiety-related behaviors, the numbers of vasopressin-immunoreactive cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and testosterone levels were used as endpoints. In addition, behavioral flexibility in mice was assessed in a group-housed environment using the IntelliCage, a fully automated mouse behavioral analysis system. In adult male mice exposed to ACE at both low and high doses, a significant reduction of anxiety level was found in the light-dark transition test. Males in the low-dose group also showed a significant increase in sexual and aggressive behaviors. In contrast, neither the anxiety levels nor the sexual behaviors of females were altered. No reductions in the testosterone level, the number of vasopressin-immunoreactive cells, or behavioral flexibility were detected in either sex. These results suggest the possibility that in utero and lactational ACE exposure interferes with the development of the neural circuits required for executing socio-sexual and anxiety-related behaviors in male mice specifically.},

This explains, at least partly, the learning deficits observed in patients after radiotherapy, particularly in pediatric cases. An 8 Gy single irradiation dose was delivered to the whole brains of postnatal day 9 (P9) C57BL/6 mice, and BrdU-labeled, syngeneic NSPCs (1.0 \texttimes{} 105 cells/injection) were grafted into each hippocampus on P21. Three months later, behavior tests were performed. Irradiation impaired novelty-induced exploration, place learning, reversal learning, and sugar preference, and it altered the movement pattern. Grafting of NSPCs ameliorated or even normalized the observed deficits. Less than 4\% of grafted cells survived and were found in the dentate gyrus 5 months later. The irradiation-induced loss of endogenous, undifferentiated NSPCs in the dentate gyrus was completely restored by grafted NSPCs in the dorsal, but not the ventral, blade. The grafted NSPCs did not exert appreciable effects on the endogenous NSPCs; however, more than half of the grafted NSPCs differentiated. These results point to novel strategies aimed at ameliorating the debilitating late effects of cranial radiotherapy, particularly in children.},

  abstract = {Resilience to stress is critical for the development of depression. Enhanced adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) signaling mediates the antidepressant effects of acute sleep deprivation (SD). However, chronic SD causes long-lasting upregulation of brain A1R and increases the risk of depression. To investigate the effects of A1R on mood, we utilized two transgenic mouse lines with inducible A1R overexpression in forebrain neurons. These two lines have identical levels of A1R increase in the cortex, but differ in the transgenic A1R expression in the hippocampus. Switching on the transgene promotes robust antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in both lines. The mice of the line without transgenic A1R overexpression in the hippocampus (A1Hipp-) show very strong resistance towards development of stress-induced chronic depression-like behavior. In contrast, the mice of the line in which A1R upregulation extends to the hippocampus (A1Hipp+), exhibit decreased resilience to depression as compared to A1Hipp-. Similarly, automatic analysis of reward behavior of the two lines reveals that depression resistant A1Hipp-transgenic mice exhibit high sucrose preference, while mice of the vulnerable A1Hipp + line developed stress-induced anhedonic phenotype. The A1Hipp + mice have increased Homer1a expression in hippocampus, correlating with impaired long-term potentiation in the CA1 region, mimicking the stressed mice. Furthermore, virus-mediated overexpression of Homer1a in the hippocampus decreases stress resilience. Taken together our data indicate for first time that increased expression of A1R and Homer1a in the hippocampus modulates the resilience to stress-induced depression and thus might potentially mediate the detrimental effects of chronic sleep restriction on mood.},

In the last decade, the habenula has gained increased attention due to its major role to modulate emotional behavior and related psychopathologies, including depression and bipolar disorder, through the modulation of monoamines' neurotransmission. However, it is still unclear which genetic factors may directly affect the function of the habenula and hence, could contribute to the psychopathological mechanisms of mood disorders. Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) gene is among robust gene-candidates predisposing to major depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in humans. DISC1-Q31L, a well-established genetic mouse model of depression, offers a unique opportunity for translational studies. The current study aimed to probe morphological features of the habenula in the DISC1-Q31L mouse line and detect novel behavioral endophenotypes, including the increased emotionality in mutant females, high aggression in mutant males and deficient extinction of fear memory in DISC1 mutant mice of both sexes. The histological analysis found the increased neural density in the lateral and medial habenula in DISC1-Q31L mice regardless of sex, hence, excluding direct association between the habenular neurons and emotionality in mutant females.},

Clinical observations have reported that chronic sleep deprivation (SD) may serve as a risk factor for AD. However, the pathological evidence for this assumption is still lacking. In the present study, we examined the potential impacts of chronic SD on learning-memory and AD-related pathologies in A{$\beta$}PP(swe)/PS1({$\Delta$}E9) transgenic (TG) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. Results indicated that mice (both TG and WT) exposed to 2-month SD showed an altered amyloid-{$\beta$} protein precursor processing, an elevated level of phosphorylated tau protein, and impaired cognitive performance as compared to non-sleep deprivation (NSD) controls. Moreover, the SD-treated TG mice exhibited more amyloid-{$\beta$}(1-42) production and developed more senile plaques in the cortex and hippocampus than NSD-treated TG mice. In addition, SD caused a striking neuronal mitochondrial damage, caspase cascade activation, and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus of both TG and WT mice. More importantly, all these behavioral, neuropathological, and biochemical changes induced by chronic SD were long lasting and were irreversible during a 3-month normal housing condition. Collectively, these results indicate that chronic SD impairs learning and memory, exacerbates AD pathologies, and aggravates the mitochondria-mediated neuronal apoptosis in a long-lasting manner. Our findings provide important experimental evidence to prove that chronic SD is a risk factor for AD.},

  abstract = {Decreases in the ratio of neurotrophic versus neurodegenerative signalling play a critical role in Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis and recent evidence suggests that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) contributes significantly to disease progression. p75NTR signalling intermediates substantially overlap with those promoting neuronal survival and synapse integrity and with those affected by the mutant huntingtin (muHtt) protein. MuHtt increases p75NTR-associated deleterious signalling and decreases survival signalling suggesting that p75NTR could be a valuable therapeutic target. This hypothesis was investigated by examining the effects of an orally bioavailable, small molecule p75NTR ligand, LM11A-31, on HD-related neuropathology in HD mouse models (R6/2, BACHD). LM11A-31 restored striatal AKT and other pro-survival signalling while inhibiting c-Jun kinase (JNK) and other degenerative signalling. Normalizing p75NTR signalling with LM11A-31 was accompanied by reduced Htt aggregates and striatal cholinergic interneuron degeneration as well as extended survival in R6/2 mice. The p75NTR ligand also decreased inflammation, increased striatal and hippocampal dendritic spine density, and improved motor performance and cognition in R6/2 and BACHD mice. These results support small molecule modulation of p75NTR as an effective HD therapeutic strategy. LM11A-31 has successfully completed Phase I safety and pharmacokinetic clinical trials and is therefore a viable candidate for clinical studies in HD.},

Animal models commonly used to test these symptoms typically last less than two weeks, which is presumably too short to observe the alterations in the brain that accompany drug addiction. Here, we analyzed the phenotypic and molecular effects of nearly lifelong morphine or saccharin intake in C57BL/6J mice. We used multiple paradigms to evaluate the symptoms of compulsive drug intake: a progressive ratio schedule, intermittent access and a schedule involving a risk of punishment were programmed into an automated IntelliCage system. Gene expression profiles were evaluated in the striatum using whole-genome microarrays and further validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in the striatum and the prefrontal cortex. Mice voluntary self-administering morphine showed addiction-related behavioral pattern that included: higher motivation to work for a drug reward, increased reward seeking and increased craving. The analysis of molecular changes revealed a tolerance effect in the transcriptional response to morphine injection (20 mg/kg, ip), as well as some long-lasting alterations in gene expression profiles between the analyzed groups of animals. Interestingly, among the morphine-drinking animals, certain transcriptional profiles were found to be associated with alterations in behavior. In conclusion, our model represents a novel approach for investigating the behavioral and molecular mechanisms underlying opioid addiction. Prolonged morphine intake caused adaptive processes in the brain that manifested as altered behavior and transcriptional sensitivity to opioids.},

  abstract = {Here, we describe a new model of voluntary alcohol drinking by group-housed mice. The model employs sensor-equipped cages that track the behaviors of the individual animals via implanted radio chips. After the animals were allowed intermittent access to alcohol (three 24 h intervals every week) for 4 weeks, the proportions of licks directed toward bottles containing alcohol were 50.9\% and 39.6\% for the male and female mice, respectively. We used three approaches (i.e., quinine adulteration, a progressive ratio schedule and a schedule involving a risk of punishment) to test for symptoms of compulsive alcohol drinking. The addition of 0.01\% quinine to the alcohol solution did not significantly affect intake, but 0.03\% quinine induced a greater than 5-fold reduction in the number of licks on the alcohol bottles. When the animals were required to perform increasing numbers of instrumental responses to obtain access to the bottle with alcohol (i.e., a progressive ratio schedule), they frequently reached a maximum of 21 responses irrespective of the available reward. Although the mice rarely achieved higher response criteria, the number of attempts was ,10 times greater in case of alcohol than water. We have developed an approach for mapping social interactions among animals that is based on analysis of the sequences of entries into the cage corners. This approach allowed us to identify the mice that followed other animals in non-random fashions. Approximately half of the mice displayed at least one interaction of this type. We have not yet found a clear correlation between imitative behavior and relative alcohol preference. In conclusion, the model we describe avoids the limitations associated with testing isolated animals and reliably leads to stable alcohol drinking. Therefore, this model may be well suited to screening for the effects of genetic mutations or pharmacological treatments on alcohol-induced behaviors.},

Whole-cell patch clamp was used to assess silent synapses. Motivation for alcohol in human subjects was assessed on the basis of a Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism interview. RESULTS: Mice devoid of MMP-9 (MMP-9 knockout) drank as much alcohol as wild-type animals; however, they were impaired in alcohol seeking during the motivation test and withdrawal. The deficit could be rescued by overexpression of exogenous MMP-9 in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Furthermore, the impaired alcohol seeking was associated with structural alterations of dendritic spines in the CeA and, moreover, whole-cell patch clamp analysis of the basal amygdala to CeA projections showed that alcohol consumption and withdrawal were associated with generation of silent synapses. These plastic changes were impaired in MMP-9 knockout mice. Finally, C/T polymorphism of MMP-9 gene at position \textendash 1562, which upregulates MMP-9 expression, correlated with increased motivation for alcohol in alcoholics. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, our results indicate a novel mechanism of alcohol craving that involves MMP9\textendash dependent synaptic plasticity in CeA.},

  abstract = {Background: Understanding the neurobiology of depression and the mechanism of action of therapeutic mea\- sures is currently a research priority. We have shown that the expression of the synaptic protein Homer1a correlates with depression-like behavior and its induction is a common mechanism of action of different anti\- depressant treatments. However, the mechanism of Homer1a regulation is still unknown. Methods: We combined the chronic despair mouse model (CDM) of chronic depression with different anti\- depressant treatments. Depression-like behavior was characterized by forced swim and tail suspension tests, and via automatic measurement of sucrose preference in IntelliCage. The Homer1 mRNA expression and promoter DNA methylation were analyzed in cortex and peripheral blood by qRT-PCR and pyrosequencing. Results: CDM mice show decreased Homer1a and Homer1b/c mRNA expression in cortex and blood samples, while chronic treatment with imipramine and fluoxetine or acute ketamine application increases their level only in the cortex. The quantitative analyses of the methylation of 7 CpG sites, located on the Homer1 promoter region containing several CRE binding sites, show a significant increase in DNA methylation in the cortex of CDM mice. In contrast, antidepressant treatments reduce the methylation level. Limitations: Homer1 expression and promotor methylation were not analyzed in different blood cell types. Other CpG sites of Homer1 promoter should be investigated in future studies. Our experimental approach does not distinguish between methylation and hydroxymethylation. Conclusions: We demonstrate that stress-induced depression-like behavior and antidepressant treatments are associated with epigenetic alterations of Homer1 promoter, providing new insights into the mechanism of an\- tidepressant treatment.},

Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2, TLR4) are well-characterised for their role in inflammatory events, and their combined activation has been implicated in neurological diseases. We therefore determined whether TLR2 and TLR4 double gene knockout (GKO) mice showed modified behaviour and cognitive function during a 16-day test sequence that employed the automated IntelliCage test system. The IntelliCage features a home cage environment in which groups of mice live and where water reward is gained through performing various tasks centred on drinking stations in each corner of the apparatus. All mice were tested twice, one month apart (the first sequence termed ``R1''and the second ``R2''). There were fewer corner visits and nosepokes in TLR2/4 GKO compared to wild-type mice during early exploration in R1, suggesting elevated neophobia in GKO mice. Reduced exploration persisted over subsequent test modules during the dark phase. TLR2/4 GKO mice also displayed increased corner visits during drinking sessions compared to non-drinking sessions, but this was not associated with increased drinking. In subsequent, more complex test modules, TLR2/4 GKO mice had unimpaired spatial learning, but showed markedly poorer performance in a visual discrimination reversal task compared to wild-type mice. These results indicated subtle impairments in behaviour and cognitive functions due to double deficiency in TLR2 and TLR4. These finding are highly relevant to understanding the combined actions of TLR2 and TLR4 on neurological status in a range of different disease conditions.},

  abstract = {During pneumococcal meningitis, clearance of bacteria by recruited neutrophils is crucial for host protection. However, these innate immune mechanisms are often insufficient and treatment with antibiotics is necessary to prevent death. Despite this antibiotic treatment, approximately half of all survivors suffer lifelong neurological problems. There is growing evidence indicating the harmful effects of neutrophils on CNS integrity. Therefore, the present study investigated the roles of neutrophils in the acute inflammatory response and the resulting long-term neuropsychological effects in murine pneumococcal meningitis. Long-term behavioural and cognitive functions in mice were measured using an automated IntelliCage system. Neutrophil depletion with antibody 1A8 as adjunctive therapy was shown to remarkably impair survival in meningitic C57BL/6J mice despite antibiotic (ceftriaxone) treatment. This was accompanied by increased bacterial load in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and an increase in IL-1b, but decrease in TNF, within the CSF at 20 h after bacterial inoculation. In the longer term, the surviving neutrophil-depleted post-meningitic (PM) mice displayed reduced diurnal hypolocomotion compared to PM mice treated with an isotype antibody. However, they showed nocturnal hyperactivity, and greater learning impairment in a patrolling task that is believed to depend upon an intact hippocampus. The data thus demonstrate two important mechanisms: 1. Neutrophil extravasation into the CNS during pneumococcal meningitis influences the pro-inflammatory response and is central to control of the bacterial load, an increase in which may lead to death. 2. Neutrophil-mediated changes in the acute inflammatory response modulate the neuropsychological sequelae in mice that survive pneumococcal meningitis.},

  abstract = {Tryptophan, an amino acid involved in routine energy metabolism, is a key modulator of sickness behaviors associated with inflammatory states and also plays roles in some psychiatric disorders. Tissue concentrations of tryptophan are regulated primarily by the enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), IDO2 and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO, encoded by TDO2). Altered IDO1 and TDO activities have been linked to the perturbed serotonergic neurotransmission that may underlie certain psychopathologies. Here we assessed mice genetically modified to be deficient in IDO1, IDO2 or TDO2 for their behavior and cognitive function using an automated home cage system, the IntelliCageTM. A wellestablished behavioural and cognitive test battery was applied during two periods (Runs 1 and 2, ``R1'' and ``R2'') separated by one month. Various tryptophan-related neurochemicals also were measured in brain extracts. IDO1-/- mice displayed remarkable reductions of early diurnal exploration in the IntelliCage and this persisted in R2. In contrast, early diurnal hyperactivity was observed in IDO2-/- mice in both R1 and R2. TDO2-/- mice displayed increased diurnal and nocturnal exploration, but only in R2. Cognitive assessment suggested enhanced reference memory in IDO2-/- mice in a complex patrolling task, while TDO deficiency was associated with enhanced performance in complex patrolling and discrimination reversal tasks. Neurochemical measures showed attenuated brain serotonin levels in IDO1-/- mice and augmented tryptophan and serotonin levels in TDO2-/- animals, respectively. No neurochemical alterations were detected in IDO2-/- mice. Taken together, these findings reveal complex and dissimilar patterns of behavioral and cognitive changes induced by knockout of three different tryptophan-metabolizing enzymes.},

  abstract = {Pneumococcal meningitis often results in death or neurological sequelae, but the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. In C57BL/6J mice subjected to intracerebroventricular (icv) challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the chemokine CCL2 and cytokines interferon-///, interleukin (IL)-1NL, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor were prominently expressed in the brain during the acute phase of the disease. The upregulation of these immune mediators was markedly diminished in IL-18-deficient mice. Uninfected IL-18-/- mice exhibited decreases in anxiety phenotype and licking behaviour, and an increase in behavioural habituation, in an automated monitoring system (the IntelliCageTM). Without antibiotic intervention, a majority of IL-18+/+ mice developed irreversible disease after icv S. pneumoniae but this was significantly improved by deleting IL-18 gene function. IL-18+/+ mice cured of pneumococcal meningitis with four doses of ceftriaxone, initiated at 20 h post-inoculation, showed enduring sequelae. These included abnormal behavioural phenotypes featuring diurnal hypoactivity and nocturnal hyperactivity, light phobia and disrupted cognitive function. While the hyperactive phenotype was absent in the corresponding IL-18-/- survivors, cognitive impairments and behavioural deficits were still present. Overall, the results suggest that the high levels of cytokines and/or chemokines released after pneumococcal challenge provoked a series of pathological events, ultimately causing acute death. Furthermore, since only a subset of behavioural phenotypes were ameliorated in the pneumococcus-infected IL-18-/- mice, the pathological pathways causing mortality may be, at least in part, distinct from those leading to long-term neurological sequelae.},

  abstract = {Pneumococcal meningitis is a lethal form of bacterial infection in the central nervous system that often causes lifelong neurological sequelae, despite therapeutic advances. The contemporary view is that the inflammatory response to infection contributes to the functional disabilities among survivors of this disease. We previously have established a mouse model of neurobehavioural deficits, using an automated IntelliCageTM system that revealed long-term behavioural and cognitive deficits in C57BL/6J female mice cured of meningitis by ceftriaxone treatment. We now have investigated the roles of two kynurenine pathway enzymes, indoleamine dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) and tryptophan dioxygenase-2 (TDO2), in the pathomechanisms of pneumococcal meningitis. Since tryptophan metabolism has long been implicated in behavioural and cognitive modulation through the production of neuroactive compounds, we hypothesised that preventing the actions of these enzymes through gene knockout would be beneficial in mice subjected to pneumococcal infection. We found no significant effect of IDO1 or TDO2 on mortality. Post-meningitic wild-type mice showed long-term diurnal hypoactivity and nocturnal hyperactivity when they were exposed to an Intellicage adaptation test throughout both the light and dark phases. These changes were not apparent in IDO1-/- survivors, but were present in the TDO2-/- survivors. Both IDO1-/- and TDO2-/- survivors were not protected against developing long-term cognitive deficits as measured in IntelliCage-based patrolling or reversal tasks. Collectively, these observations suggest (i) involvement of the kynurenine pathway in causing some behavioural sequelae of pneumococcal meningitis and (ii) that this pathway might operate synergistically with, or independently of, other pathways to cause other aspects of neurological sequelae.},

Survivors are predisposed to developing lifelong disabling sequelae, including cognitive impairment, psychological problems and motor deficits. In our experimental model, ventricular inoculation of 105 colony-forming units of S. pneumoniae type 3 caused 90\% of mice to develop life-threatening meningitis within 48 h. Antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone 20 h post infection reduced the incidence of severe meningitis to {$<$}10\%. At the time of treatment, upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines was detected, including interleukin-1b, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor. We evaluated the long-term behavioural and cognitive sequelae in control mice and those surviving meningitis using an automated system (the IntelliCage) in which mice perform a range of behavioural and spatial tasks to obtain water rewards from conditioning units in their home cage. Surviving mice showed a number of altered behaviours relative to controls, including (i) hypoexploration when first exposed to the IntelliCage, (ii) altered activity patterns (fewer visits to conditioning stations during the light phase and more in the dark phase), (iii) avoidance of light (a constant or flashing LED stimulus), (iv) impaired spatial learning (a complex patrolling task), and (v) impaired discrimination reversal learning. Overall these results suggest photophobia and weakened learning ability in post-meningitic mice, particularly on tasks engaging hippocampal and prefrontal neural substrates. This study also demonstrates a standardised and comprehensive battery of tests that can be readily used to investigate neurological sequelae in undisturbed mice residing in a complex home cage environment.},

The absence of IFN-c significantly lengthened the survival of mice that otherwise would have developed fatal clinical signs within two days of CNS infection.

IFN-c\`A/\`A mice, however, showed decreased neuronal damage in both hippocampus and cortex.

  abstract = {Background: The need for improving throughput, validity, and reliability in the behavioral characterization of rodents may benefit from integrating automated intra-home-cage-screening systems allowing the simultaneous detection of multiple behavioral and physiological parameters in parallel. New method: To test this hypothesis, transgenic Huntington's disease (tgHD) rats were repeatedly screened within phenotyping home-cages (PhenoMaster and IntelliCage for rats), where spontaneous activity, feeding, drinking, temperature, and metabolic performance were continuously measured. Cognition and emotionality were evaluated within the same environment by means of operant learning procedures and refined analysis of the behavioral display under conditions of novelty. This investigatorindependent approach was further correlated with behavioral display of the animals in classical behavioral assays. Multivariate analysis (MVA) including Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to explore correlation patterns of variables within and across the two genotypes. Results: The automated systems traced previously undetected aspects in the phenotype of tgHD rats (circadian activity, energy metabolism, rearing), and out of those spontaneous free rearing correlated with individual performance in the accelerod test. PCA revealed a segregation by genotype in juvenile tgHD rats that differed from adult animals, being further resolved by PLS-DA detecting ``temperature'' (juvenile) and ``rearing'' (adult) as phenotypic key variables in the tgHD model. Conclusions: Intra-home-cage phenotyping in combination with MVA, is capable of characterizing a complex phenotype by detecting novel physiological and behavioral markers with high sensitivity and standardization using fewer human resources. A broader application of automated systems for large-scale screening is encouraged.},

Here, we assessed the association of adult hippocampal neurogenesis with behavioral responses to novelty, temporal and spatial sequence and reversal learning in wild, wild-derived and laboratory rodents using an automated testing apparatus, the IntelliCage. Behaviorally, DBA/2 and wild-derived house mice were quickest to explore a novel environment, wild wood mice and bank voles were slowest, and C57BL/6 intermediate. Rule learning (temporal and spatial) was fastest in wood mice and bank voles, while DBA/2 and house mice performed poorer. C57BL/6 performed similar to the house mice in the temporal task and similar to wild rodents in the spatial task. Using the number of DCX-positive neurons and proliferating, Ki67-positive cells in the septal, intermediate and temporal hippocampus as a proxy, an ANCOVA was used to test for within-group relations between neurogenesis and behavior. We found that higher numbers of DCX-positive cells in the temporal hippocampus were associated with an increased latency and a lower frequency to explore a novel environment. Temporal and spatial sequence learning was not associated with neurogenesis. In the spatial reversal task however, animals with higher septal neurogenesis showed a persevering phenotype and slower re-learning. Our findings provide strong evidence of septo-temporally segregated neurogenesis effects on behavior across five rodent strains and species. While temporal neurogenesis covaries with behavioral responses to novelty, septal neurogenesis relates to perseverance of a successfully learned spatial rule. Importantly, these associations were independent of species or strain and can be found in both wild and domesticated rodents.},

However, the role of new neurons in behavior is still equivocal. Conflicting results may be due to the difficulty in manipulating neurogenesis without off-target effects as well as the statistical approach used, which fail to account for neurogenesisindependent effects of experimental manipulations on behavior. In this study, we apply a more comprehensive statistical and conceptual approach. Instead of between-group analyses, we consider the withingroup relationships between neurogenesis and behavior (ANCOVA and mediation analysis) in a large-scale experiment, in which distinct age(3 and 5 months) and strain- (DBA and C57) related differences in basal levels of neurogenesis in mice are compared with a large number (\textasciitilde 1,500) of behavioral read outs. The analysis failed to detect any association between anxiety and motor impulsivity with neurogenesis. However, within-group adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with the reaction to novelty. Specifically, more neurogenesis is associated with a longer latency to explore and a lower frequency of exploratory actions, overall indicative of a phenotype where animals with more neurogenesis were slower to explore a novel environment. This effect is observed in 5-months-old, but not in 3-months-old mice of both strains. An association between the reaction to novelty and adult neurogenesis can have a major impact on results from previous studies using classical behavioral experiments, in which animals are tested in a\textemdash for the animal\textemdash novel experimental set-up. The neurogenesis\textendash novelty association found here is also a necessary link in the relation that has been suggested to exist between neurogenesis and psychiatric disorders marked by a failure to cope with novelty.

  abstract = {Background: Modern molecular genetics create a rapidly growing number of mutant mouse lines, many of which need to be phenotyped behaviorally. Poor reliability and low efficiency of traditional behavioral tests have prompted the development of new approaches to behavioral phenotyping, such as fully automated analysis of behavior in the homecage. New method: We asked whether the analysis of spontaneous behavior during the first week in the social homecage system IntelliCage could provide useful prescreening information before specialized and time consuming test batteries are run. To determine how much behavioral variation is captured in this data, we performed principal component analysis on free adaptation data of 1552 mice tested in the IntelliCage during the past years. We then computed individual component scores to characterize and compare groups of mice. Result: We found 11 uncorrelated components which accounted for 82\% of total variance. They characterize frequency and properties of corner visits and nosepokes, drinking activity, spatial distribution, as well as diurnal time course of activity. Behavioral profiles created using individual component scores were highly characteristic for different inbred strains or different lesion models of the nervous system. They were also remarkably stable across labs and experiments. Comparison with existing methods: Monitoring of mutant mice with known deficits in hippocampusdependent tests produced profiles very similar to those of hippocampally lesioned mice. Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that already the monitoring of spontaneous behavior during a week of free adaptation in the IntelliCage can contribute significantly to high throughput prescreening of mutant mice.},

  abstract = {Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are unique with regard to their diversity, quantity and complexity, particularly in comparison to bovine milk oligosaccharides. HMOs are associated with functional development during early life, mainly related to immunity and intestinal health. Whether HMOs elicit a positive effect on cognitive capabilities of lactating infants remains an open question. This study evaluated the role of the most abundant HMO, 2{${'}$}-fucosyllactose (2{${'}$}-FL), in synaptic plasticity and learning capabilities in rodents. Mice and rats were prepared for the chronic recording of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked at the hippocampal CA3\textendash CA1 synapse. Following chronic oral administration of 2{${'}$}-FL, both species showed improvements in input/output curves and in long-term potentiation (LTP) evoked experimentally in alert behaving animals. This effect on LTP was related to better performance of animals in various types of learning behavioral tests. Mice were tested for spatial learning, working memory and operant conditioning using the IntelliCage system, while rats were submitted to a fixed-ratio schedule in the Skinner box. In both cases, 2{${'}$}-FL-treated animals performed significantly better than controls. In addition, chronic administration of 2{${'}$}-FL increased the expression of different molecules involved in the storage of newly acquired memories, such as the postsynaptic density protein 95, phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in cortical and subcortical structures. Taken together, the data show that dietary 2{${'}$}-FL affects cognitive domains and improves learning and memory in rodents.},

These mice phenocopied some of the abnormalities observed in patients with CS, including facial dysmorphia and cardiomyopathies. We investigated here their neurological and behavioral phenotype. The analysis of H-RasG12V mice revealed phenotypes that resembled the hyperemotivity, hypersensibility and cognitive impairments observed in children with CS. Stronger neurological deficits were found in the analysis of mice homozygous for this mutation than in the analysis of heterozygous mice, suggesting the existence of a gene dose effect.

Recent evidence suggests beneficial effects of pro-cannabinoid treatments. We assessed in mice levels of endocannabinoids in association with the occurrence and persistence of comparable               sequelae               after controlled cortical impact in mice using a set of long-term behavioral observations in IntelliCages, motor and nociception tests in two sequential cohorts of TBI/sham mice. TBI mice maintained lower body weights, and they had persistent low levels of brain ethanolamide endocannabinoids (eCBs: AEA, OEA, PEA) in perilesional and subcortical ipsilateral brain tissue (6~months), but rapidly recovered motor functions (within days), and average nociceptive responses were within normal limits, albeit with high variability, ranging from loss of thermal sensation to hypersensitivity. TBI mice showed persistent non-goal directed nighttime hyperactivity, i.e. they visited rewarding and non-rewarding operant corners with high frequency and random success. On successful visits, they made more licks than sham mice resulting in net over-licking. The lower the eCBs the stronger was the hyperactivity. In reward-based learning and reversal learning tasks, TBI mice were not inferior to sham mice, but avoidance memory was less stable. Hence, the major late behavioral TBI phenotype was non-goal directed nighttime hyperactivity and "over-licking" in association with low ipsilateral brain eCBs. The behavioral phenotype would agree with a "post-TBI hyperactivity disorder". The association with persistently low eCBs in perilesional and subcortical regions suggests that eCB deficiency contribute to the post-TBI psychopathology.},

Sequential testing started at 51\textendash 172 days after bilateral lesions and lasted for 154 and 218 days in two batches of mice, respectively. Spontaneous undisturbed behavioral patterns clearly separated the three groups, hippocampals being characterized by more erratic hyperactivity, and strongly impaired circadian synchronization ability. Hippocampal lesions led to deficits in spatial passive avoidance, as well as in spatial reference and working memory tasks. Impairment was minimal in rewarded preference/reversal schemes, but prominent if behavioral responses required precise circadian timing or included punishment of wrong spatial choices. No differences between sham-operated and prefrontally lesioned subjects in conditioning success were discernible. These results corroborate the view that hippocampal dysfunction spares simple spatial learning tasks but impairs the ability to cope with conflicting task-inherent spatial, temporal or emotional cues. Methodologically, the results show that automated testing and data analysis of socially kept mice is a powerful, efficient and animal-friendly tool for dissecting complex features and behavioral profiles of hippocampal dysfunction characterizing many transgenic or pharmacological mouse models.},

  abstract = {The IntelliCage allows fully automated continuous testing of various behaviours in the home cage environment without handling the mice. Here we tested whether conditioned avoidance is retained after a time period delay spent outside the IntelliCage. During the training, nosepokes in one of the four learning corners were punished with an air-puff. After 24 h of training, the mice were placed in regular cages for 24 h. During the last 18 h of this interval, the mice were water deprived and then returned to the IntelliCage for a probe trial where drinking was allowed in all corners. The C57BL/6 mice developed a significant suppression of nosepoking in the punished corner during training, and the avoidance was carried over to the following probe trial. Repetition of the experiment by delivering punishment in a different corner assigned to individual mice revealed a similar performance pattern. Comparison between the different strains revealed a reduced nosepoke suppression in DBA/2 and B6D2F1 mice as compared to C57BL/6 mice in the probe trial, despite similar error rates during the training with short (1-s) air-puffs. However, the performance of the three strains in the probe trial were equalised when the air-puffs were prolonged until the end of the corner visit. Significant extinction of the nosepoke suppression occurred after 6 days. A prolonged interval (7 days) between the training and the probe trial resulted in a loss of suppression in DBA/2 mice, but not in C57BL/6 and B6D2F1 mice. Additional experiments revealed that performance in the probe trial was dependent on a complex set of intramaze cues. Testing of mice with bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus or dorso-lateral striatum revealed that learning this task was dependent on an intact hippocampus, but not on an intact striatum. In summary, the conditioned nosepoke suppression test presented here is sensitive to both genetic differences and hippocampal lesions. This test could be applied to the screening of mutant mice with impaired hippocampal functions more efficiently than those of the standard memory tests.},

Moreover, LRRTM1-knockout mice show increased social interaction, reduced nest building and MK801-induced locomotion, and slower swim speed but normal water maze learning. Since LRRTM1 is predominantly expressed in thalamus, hippocampus and limbic cortex, specific synaptic defects in those areas presumably cause these behavioural abnormalities.},

  abstract = {Animal models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders require extensive behavioral phenotyping. Currently, this presents several caveats and the most important are: (i) rodents are nocturnal animals, but mostly tested during the light period; (ii) the conventional behavioral experiments take into consideration only a snapshot of a rich behavioral repertoire; and (iii) environmental factors, as well as experimenter influence, are often underestimated. Consequently, serious concerns have been expressed regarding the reproducibility of research findings on the one hand, and appropriate welfare of the animals (based on the principle of 3Rs\textemdash reduce, refine and replace) on the other hand. To address these problems and improve behavioral phenotyping in general, several solutions have been proposed and developed. Undisturbed, 24/7 home-cage monitoring (HCM) is gaining increased attention and popularity as demonstrating the potential to substitute or complement the conventional phenotyping methods by providing valuable data for identifying the behavioral patterns that may have been missed otherwise. In this review, we will briefly describe the different technologies used for HCM systems. Thereafter, based on our experience, we will focus on two systems, IntelliCage (NewBehavior AG and TSE-systems) and Digital Ventilated Cage (DVC , Tecniplast)\textemdash how they have been developed and applied during recent years. Additionally, we will touch upon the importance of the environmental/experimenter artifacts and propose alternative suggestions for performing phenotyping experiments based on the published evidence. We will discuss how the integration of telemetry systems for deriving certain physiological parameters can help to complement the description of the animal model to offer better translation to human studies. Ultimately, we will discuss how such HCM data can be statistically interpreted and analyzed.},

The broad scope of behavioral testing in relation to the neurosciences is discussed, as are the fine details of various test situations. Mistakes made in past research are scrutinized and lessons are drawn about how to avoid them in future work. Diverse factors that can influence the results of behavioral experiments are discussed, ranging from the specific parameters employed in a test to the laboratory environment outside the test situation itself. Throughout the book, emphasis is placed on special issues that arise when testing genetically different mice, including inbred strains and mice with targeted mutations. This knowledge will assist an investigator who lacks formal training in behavioral psychology to build a behavioral testing lab and insure that its output meets current standards of good practice in behavioral neuroscience research. The book will be a convenient manual of procedures for daily use in studies of mouse behavior. It will be of interest even to experienced behavioural researchers, but of particular value to scientists just beginning work with mice, including undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral investigators who want to collect phenotypic data with knockout and other genetically defined mice.

At the cellular level, clock regulation is established by a self-sustained Bmal1-dependent transcriptional oscillator network. However, it is still unclear how different tissues achieve a synchronized rhythmic physiology. That is, do they respond independently to environmental signals, or require interactions with each other to do so? We show that unexpectedly, light synchronizes the Bmal1-dependent circadian machinery in single tissues in the absence of Bmal1 in all other tissues. Strikingly, light-driven tissue autonomous clocks occur without rhythmic feeding behavior and are lost in constant darkness. Importantly, tissue-autonomous Bmal1 partially sustains homeostasis in otherwise arrhythmic and prematurely aging animals. Our results therefore support a two-branched model for the daily synchronization of tissues: an autonomous response branch, whereby light entrains circadian clocks without any commitment of other Bmal1-dependent clocks, and a memory branch using other Bmal1-dependent clocks to ``remember'' time in the absence of external cues.},

Here we assessed learning and memory of Nes-/- mice in a home cage set up using the IntelliCage system, in which the mice learn in which cage corner a nose poke earns access to drinking water. Nes-/- and wildtype mice showed comparable place learning assessed as the incorrect corner visit ratio and the incorrect nose poke ratio. However, during reversal place learning, a more challenging task, Nes-/- mice, compared to wildtype mice, showed improved learning over time demonstrated by the incorrect visit ratio and improved memory extinction over time assessed as nose pokes per visit to the previous drinking corner. In addition, Nes-/- mice showed increased explorative activity as judged by the increased total numbers of corner visits and nose pokes.

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Insular function has gradually become a topic of intense study in cognitive research. Recognition memory is a commonly studied type of memory in memory research. G\- ABABR has been shown to be closely related to memory formation. In the present study, we used intellicage, which is a new intelligent behavioural test system, and a bilateral drug microinjection technique to inject into the bilateral insula, to examine the relationship between \-GABABR and recognition memory. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Male Sprague\textendash Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, Sham, Nacl, baclofen and CGP35348 groups. Different testing procedures were employed using intellicage to detect changes in rat recognition memory. The expression of \-GABABR (GB1, GB2) in the insula of rats was determined by immunofluorescence and western blot-ting at the protein level. In addition, the expression of \-GABABR \-(GB1, \-GB2) was detected by RT-PCR at the mRNA level. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The results of the intellicage test showed that recognition memory was impaired in terms of position learn-ing, punitive learning and punitive reversal learning by using baclofen and CGP35348. In position reversal learning, no significant differences were found in terms of cognitive memory ability between the control groups and the CGP and baclofen groups. Immunofluorescence data showed \-GABABR (GB1, GB2) expression in the insula, while data from RTPCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that the relative expression of GB1 and GB2 was significantly increased in the baclofen group compared with the control groups. In the CGP35348 group, the expression of GB1 and GB2 was significantly decreased, but there was no significant difference in GB1 or GB2 expression in the control groups. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em}GABABR expression in the insula plays an important role in the formation of recognition memory in rats.},

  abstract = {Background: Sleep plays an important role in memory processing. However, its role in anesthesia-induced cognitive dysfunction was not revealed. Our study sought to investigate the connection between the cognition decline and sleep\textendash wake rhythm disorders after long-term isoflurane anesthesia in mice. Also, we examined the effect of exogenous melatonin pretreatment on both cognitive function and circadian rhythm. Furthermore, we discussed whether NR2B (N-methyl\textendash D-aspartate receptor 2B subunit)\textendash CREB (cAMPresponse element binding protein) signaling pathway was involved in this course. Methods: 2-month-old male C57/BL-6J mice were submitted to long-term anesthesia using 1\% isoflurane from CT (Circadian Time) 14 to CT20. Melatonin pretreatment were conducted before anesthesia for 7 Days. Intellicage for mice and Mini-Mitter were applied to monitor spatial memory and gross motor activity which can reflect cognition and sleep\textendash wake rhythm. Messenger RNA and protein expression of right hippocampus NR2B and CREB were examined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: 6 h isoflurane anesthesia led to impaired spatial memory from Day 3 to Day 10 in mice accompanied by the disruption of sleep\textendash wake rhythm. Meanwhile, the hippocampus CREB and NR2B expression declined in step. Melatonin pretreatment ameliorated disturbed sleep\textendash wake cycle, improved isoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction, and reversed the down-regulation of CREB and NR2B expression. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that sleep\textendash wake rhythm is involved in the isofluraneinduced cognition impairment and pretreatment of melatonin has a positive effect on circadian normalization and cognition reversal. Also, NR2B\textendash CREB signaling pathway has a critical role in this process. This study provides us a new strategy for anesthesia-induced cognitive dysfunction therapy.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate the effects of GABAB2 receptor expression in pilocarpine rat insular cortex on the impairment of recognition memory. Methods SPF-level male SD rats were used to establish an epilepsy model by lithium chloride-pilocarpine. A week later,the epilepsy rats were randomly divided into seven groups including GI,PHR,HP and three solvent control groups of GI-X、PHR-X、HP-X and normal saline with ten rats in each group. HBAAV2/9-GABAB2 R si RNA was bilaterally microinjected in group GI,PHR and HP rats. The empty carrier AAV was bilaterally microinjected in GI-X,PHR-X and HP-X rats. Simultaneously,the normal group was injected with the same volume of saline. The recognition memory of the rats was observed by Intelli Cage and the expression of GABAB2 R protein was observed by Western blot and fluorescence immunoassay. Results The visit times and nose-poke times of GI group were significantly more than GI-X group and control group（P{$<$}0.05）. The visit times and nose-poke times of PHR group were significantly more than PHR-X group and control group（P{$<$}0.05）. The visit times and nose-poke times of HP group were significantly more than HP-X group and control group（P{$<$}0.05）. Conclusion Inhibition of GABAB2 R activity in Insular cortex shows improvement and support for the damage to the recognition memory function of the lithium chloride-pilocarpine epileptic rats.},

  abstract = {The role of estrogen receptors in neuroprotection and cognition has been extensively studied in humans over the past 20 years. Recently, studies have shifted their focus to the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators in the treatment of mental illnesses in the central nervous system. We conducted this study to test the behavioral changes shown by G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 knockout (GPER1 KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with MK-801-induced schizophrenia (SZ). GPER1 KO and WT mice received intraperitoneal injections of MK-801 for 14 continuous days. Behavioral, learning and memory, and social interaction changes were evaluated by using the IntelliCage system, open-field, three-chamber social interaction, and novel object recognition tests (NORT). The protein expression levels of the NR2B/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway were tested via Western blot analysis. The KO SZ group was more likely to show impaired long-term learning and memory function than the WT SZ group. Learning and memory functions were also impaired in the KO Con group. MK-801 administration to the GPER1-KO and WT groups resulted in memory deficiencies and declining learning capabilities. GPER1 deficiency downregulated the expression levels of proteins related to the NR2B/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway. Our study suggested that GPER1 played an important role in cognitive, learning, and memory functions in the MK-801-induced mouse model of SZ. The mechanism of this role might partially involve the downregulation of the proteins related to the NR2B/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway. Further studies should focus on the effect of GPER1 on the pathogenesis of SZ in vivo and in vitro.},

  abstract = {Ample evidence suggests that estrogens have strong influences on the occurrence of stress-related mood disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Through multiple approaches, we demonstrate that the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is widely distributed along the HPA axis and in brain structures critically involved in mood control. Genetic ablation of GPER in the rat resulted in significantly lower basal serum corticosterone level but enhanced ACTH release in response to acute restraint stress, especially in the female. GPER               -/-               rats of either sex displayed increased anxiety-like behaviors and deficits in learning and memory. Additionally, GPER deficiency led to aggravation of anxiety-like behaviors following single-prolonged stress (SPS). SPS caused significant decreases in serum corticosterone in WT but not in GPER-deficient rats. The results highlight an important role of GPER at multiple sites in regulation of the HPA axis and mood.},

  abstract = {Background: The accumulation of iron occurs in the central nervous system (CNS) in several neurodegenerative diseases. Although multi-copper ferroxidases (MCFs) play an important role in cellular iron metabolism and homeostasis, the mechanism of MCFs in the CNS remains unclear. Objective: The aim was to study the role of MCFs in CNS iron metabolism and homeostasis by using hephaestin/ceruloplasmin (Heph/Cp) double knockout (KO) mice. Methods: Heph/Cp double KO male mice were generated by crossing both single KO mice. In Heph/Cp KO and wildtype (WT) control mice at 4 wk and 6 mo of age, iron concentrations of selected brain regions were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and gene expressions of Heph, Cp, ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) [+ iron responsive element (IRE)], L-ferritin, H-ferritin, transferrin receptor 1 (Tfrc), and divalent metal transporter 1 (Dmt1) (+IRE) were quantitated by quantitative reverse transcriptase\textendash polymerase chain reaction. Brain region L-ferritin protein concentration, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were also determined. Learning and memory abilities in Heph/Cp KO and WT control mice at 6 mo of age were tested by the IntelliCage system (New Behavior). Results: Iron concentration was significantly higher in Heph/Cp KO mice than in WT control mice at 4 wk of age in the cortex (50\%), hippocampus (120\%), brainstem (35\%), and cerebellum (220\%) and at 6 mo of age in the cortex (140\%), hippocampus (420\%), brainstem (560\%), and cerebellum (340\%). L-Ferritin and MDA concentrations were significantly higher and SOD and GPx activities were significantly lower in the cortex, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum of KO mice than in those of WT controls at both 4 wk and 6 mo of age. Iron-related gene expressions also differed significantly between groups. Learning and memory deficits occurred in Heph/Cp KO mice at 6 mo of age. Conclusion: Mutation of both MCFs in mice induces iron accumulation in brain regions, oxidative damage, and learning and memory defects. J Nutr 2018;148:643\textendash 649.},
