  abstract = {It has been hypothesized that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most common treatment for major depression, affect mood through changes in immune function. However, the effects of SSRIs on inflammatory response are contradictory since these act either as anti- or pro-inflammatory drugs. Previous experimental and clinical studies showed that the quality of the living environment moderates the outcome of antidepressant treatment. Therefore, we hypothesized that the interplay between SSRIs and the environment may, at least partially, explain the apparent incongruence regarding the effects of SSRI treatment on the inflammatory response. In order to investigate such interplay, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to chronic stress to induce a depression-like phenotype and, subsequently, to fluoxetine treatment or vehicle (21 days) while being exposed to either an enriched or a stressful condition. At the end of treatment, we measured the expression levels of several anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in the whole hippocampus and in isolated microglia. We also determined microglial density, distribution, and morphology to investigate their surveillance state. Results show that the effects of fluoxetine treatment on inflammation and microglial function, as compared to vehicle, were dependent on the quality of the living environment. In particular, fluoxetine administered in the enriched condition increased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers compared to vehicle, while treatment in a stressful condition produced anti-inflammatory effects. These findings provide new insights regarding the effects of SSRIs on inflammation, which may be crucial to devise pharmacological strategies aimed at enhancing antidepressant efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.},

Using the IntelliCage we studied if sciatic nerve injury obstructed learning and memory in young and aged mice, each in wild type and progranulin deficient mice, which develop premature signs of brain aging. Both young and aged mice developed long-term nerve injury-evoked hyperalgesia and allodynia. In both genotypes, aged mice with neuropathic pain showed high error rates in place avoidance acquisition tasks. However, once learnt, these aged mice with neuropathic pain showed a significantly stronger maintenance of the aversive memory. Nerve injury did not affect place preference behavior in neither genotype, neither in young nor aged mice. However, nerve injury in progranulin deficient mice impaired the learning of spatial sequences of awarded places, particularly in the aged mice. This task required a discrimination of clockwise and anti-clockwise sequences. The chaining failure occurred only in progranulin deficient mice after nerve injury, but not in sham operated or wildtype mice, suggesting that progranulin was particularly important for compensatory adaptations after nerve injury. In contrast, all aged mice with neuropathic pain, irrespective of the genotype, had a long maintenance of aversive memory suggesting a negative alliance and possibly mutual aggravation of chronic neuropathic pain and aversive memory at old age.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Encephalitis has an estimated prevalence of {$\leq$}0.01\%. Even with extensive diagnostic work-up, an infectious etiology is identified or suspected in {$<$}50\% of cases, suggesting a role for etiologically unclear, noninfectious processes. Mild encephalitis runs frequently unnoticed, despite slight neuroinflammation detectable postmortem in many neuropsychiatric illnesses. A widely unexplored field in humans, though clearly documented in rodents, is genetic brain inflammation, particularly that associated with myelin abnormalities, inducing primary white matter encephalitis. We hypothesized that ``autoimmune encephalitides'' may result from any brain inflammation concurring with the presence of brain antigen-directed autoantibodies, e.g., against N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor NR1 (NMDAR1-AB), which are not causal of, but may considerably shape the encephalitis phenotype. We therefore immunized young female               Cnp               -/-               mice lacking the structural myelin protein 2{${'}$}-3{${'}$}-cyclic nucleotide 3{${'}$}-phosphodiesterase (Cnp) with a ``cocktail'' of NMDAR1 peptides.               Cnp               -/-               mice exhibit early low-grade inflammation of white matter tracts and blood\textendash brain barrier disruption. Our novel mental-time-travel test disclosed that               Cnp               -/-               mice are compromised in what\textendash where\textendash when orientation, but this episodic memory readout was not further deteriorated by NMDAR1-AB. In contrast, comparing wild-type and               Cnp               -/-               mice without/with NMDAR1-AB regarding hippocampal learning/memory and motor balance/coordination revealed distinct stair patterns of behavioral pathology. To elucidate a potential contribution of oligodendroglial NMDAR downregulation to NMDAR1-AB effects, we generated conditional NR1 knockout mice. These mice displayed normal Morris water maze and mental-time-travel, but beam balance performance was similar to immunized               Cnp               -/-               . Immunohistochemistry confirmed neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration in               Cnp               -/-               mice, yet without add-on effect of NMDAR1-AB. To conclude, genetic brain inflammation may explain an encephalitic component underlying autoimmune conditions.},

  abstract = {A barrage of information constantly assaults our senses, of which only a fraction is relevant at any given point in time. However, the neural circuitry supporting the suppression of irrelevant sensory distractors is not completely understood. The claustrum, a circuit hub with vast cortical connectivity, is an intriguing brain structure, whose restrictive anatomy, thin and elongated, has precluded functional investigation. Here, we describe the use of Egr2-CRE mice to access genetically defined claustral neurons. Utilizing conditional viruses for anterograde axonal labeling and retrograde trans-synaptic tracing, we validated this transgenic model for accessing the claustrum and extended the known repertoire of claustral input/ output connectivity. Addressing the function of the claustrum, we inactivated CLEgr2+ neurons, chronically as well as acutely, in mice performing an automated two-alternative forced-choice behavioral task. Strikingly, inhibition of CLEgr2+ neurons did not significantly impact task performance under varying delay times and cue durations, but revealed a selective role for the claustrum in supporting performance in the presence of an irrelevant auditory distractor. Further investigation of behavior, in the naturalistic maternal pupretrieval task, replicated the result of sensitization to an auditory distractor following inhibition of CLEgr2+ neurons. Initiating investigation into the underlying mechanism, we found that activation of CLEgr2+ neurons modulated cortical sensory processing, suppressing tone representation in the auditory cortex. This functional study, utilizing selective genetic access, implicates the claustrum in supporting resilience to distraction, a fundamental aspect of attention.},

  abstract = {Exposure to arsenic from well water in developing countries is suspected to cause developmental neurotoxicity. Although, it has been demonstrated that exposure to sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) suppresses neurite outgrowth of cortical neurons in vitro, it is largely unknown how developmental exposure to NaAsO2 impairs higher brain function and affects cortical histology. Here, we investigated the effect of prenatal NaAsO2 exposure on the behavior of mice in adulthood, and evaluated histological changes in the prelimbic cortex (PrL), which is a part of the medial prefrontal cortex that is critically involved in cognition. Drinking water with or without NaAsO2 (85 ppm) was provided to pregnant C3H mice from gestational days 8 to 18, and offspring of both sexes were subjected to cognitive behavioral analyses at 60 weeks of age. The brains of female offspring were subsequently harvested and used for morphometrical analyses. We found that both male and female mice prenatally exposed to NaAsO2 displayed an impaired adaptation to repetitive reversal tasks. In morphometrical analyses of Nissl- or Golgi-stained tissue sections, we found that NaAsO2 exposure was associated with a significant increase in the number of pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI of the PrL, but not other layers of the PrL. More strikingly, prenatal NaAsO2 exposure was associated with a significant decrease in neurite length but not dendrite spine density in all layers of the PrL. Taken together, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to NaAsO2 leads to behavioral inflexibility in adulthood and cortical disarrangement in the PrL might contribute to this behavioral impairment.},

However, there are only a few studies, all at relatively high doses, addressing the effect of HMB supplementation on cognition. This study evaluated the effects of different doses of HMB on the potentiation of hippocampal synapses following the experimental induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of behaving rats, as well as on working memory test (delayed matching-to-position, DMTP) in mice. HMB doses in rats were 225 (low), 450 (medium), and 900 (high) mg/kg body weight/day and were double in mice. Rats who received medium or high HMB doses improved LTP, suggesting that HMB administration enhances mechanisms related to neuronal plasticity. In the DMTP test, mice that received any of the tested doses of HMB performed better than the control group in the overall test with particularities depending on the dose and the task phase.},

  abstract = {In adult rodents, decreasing hippocampal neurogenesis experimentally using different approaches often impairs performance in hippocampus-dependent processes. Nonetheless, functional relevance of adult neurogenesis is far from being unraveled, and deficits so far described in animal models often lack reproducibility. One hypothesis is that such differences might be the consequence of the extent of the methodological specificity used to alter neurogenesis rather than the extent to which adult neurogenesis is altered. To address this, we focused on cranial irradiation, the most widely used technique to impair hippocampal neurogenesis and consequentially induce hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits. To investigate the specificity of the technique, we thus exposed 4\textendash 5 months old female cyclin D2 knockout mice, a model lacking physiological levels of olfactory and hippocampal neurogenesis, to an X-ray dose of 10 Gy, reported to specifically affect transiently amplifying precursors. After a recovery period of 1.5 months, behavioral tests were performed and probed for locomotor activity, habituation, anxiety, and spatial learning and memory. Spatial learning in the Morris water maze was intact in all experimental groups. Although spatial memory retention assessed 24 h following acquisition was also intact in all mice, irradiated wild type and cyclin D2 knockout mice displayed memory deficits one week after acquisition. In addition, we observed significant differences in tests addressing anxiety and locomotor activity dependent on the technique used to alter neurogenesis. Whereas irradiated mice were hyperactive regardless of their genotype, cyclin D2 knockout mice were hypoactive in most of the tests and displayed altered habituation. The present study emphasizes that different approaches aimed at decreasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis may result in distinct behavioral impairments related to locomotion and anxiety. In contrast, spatial long-term memory retention is consistently altered after both approaches suggesting a plausible implication of hippocampal neurogenesis in this cognitive process.},

However, the social dimension has rarely been incorporated into the analysis due to methodological limitations. This study characterized the effects of neonatal social isolation (early deprivation, ED) on adult C57BL/6 mouse behavior in a social context using our recently developed behavioral test protocols for group-housed mice. During the first two postnatal weeks, half of the pups per dam were separated from their dam and littermates for 3 h per day (ED group). Post weaning, ED and control pups were electronically tagged and co-housed. At 12 weeks, the mixed cohorts were transferred to IntelliCages, equipped with computer-controlled operant chambers. Access to the chambers was used as an index to analyze novel object response, behavioral flexibility, and competitive dominance with minimal experimenter intervention. In general, ED had greater effects on males; ED males exhibited reduced body weight, increased novelty response, and were subordinate to control littermates when competing for reward access. Male ED mice also demonstrated mildly impaired reversal learning. Analyzing gene expression changes in brain regions controlling emotion, stress, spatial memory, and executive function revealed reduced BDNF and c-Fos in hippocampal CA1, enhanced c-Fos in the basolateral amygdala, reduced Map2 while enhanced HSD11{$\beta$}2 in prefrontal cortex of ED males. In male mice, it was suggested that neonatal social isolation results in sustained changes in social behavior with altered function of limbic and frontal cortices.},

P66Shc has recently emerged as a novel mammalian gerontogene able to affect healthspan during aging. Deletion of this gene in mice leads to reduced OS accompanied by decreased incidence of age-related pathologies and reduced signs of behavioral aging. We hypothesized that p66Shc2/2 mutants might show increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory processes. To this aim, granule cell number, proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and cell death were assessed in the hippocampus in senescent p66Shc2/2 [knock out (KO)] and p66Shc1/1 [wild type (WT)] male and female mice. Spatial learning abilities and spontaneous activity were also investigated in a multifunctional behavioral system\textemdash IntelliCages. The behavioral analysis revealed that females in general perform better in spatial learning tasks, with genotype effects being apparent in the activity pattern only. Likewise, all females showed increased neuronal differentiation, whereas increased proliferation was found only in those belonging to the p66Shc2/2 genotype, indicating that they might be protected from precursor cell loss. The number of dying cells was not affected by genotype or sex; however, all KO mice showed less granule cells than WT. Overall, our data suggest that hippocampal function is protected in the female gender at older age, an effect amplified by reduced OS in the p66Shc2/2 mutant. VC 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Antidepressants represent the standard treatment for major depression. However, their efficacy is variable and incomplete. A growing number of studies suggest that the environment plays a major role in determining the efficacy of these drugs, specifically of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). A recent hypothesis posits that the increase in serotonin levels induced by SSRI may not affect mood per se, but enhances neural plasticity and, consequently, renders the individual more susceptible to the influence of the environment. Thus, SSRI administration in a favorable environment would lead to a reduction of symptoms, while in a stressful environment might lead to a worse prognosis. To test this hypothesis, we treated C57BL/6 adult male mice with chronic fluoxetine while exposing them to either (i) an enriched environment, after exposure to a chronic stress period aimed at inducing a depression-like phenotype, or (ii) a stressful environment. Anhedonia, brain BDNF and circulating corticosterone levels, considered endophenotypes of depression, were investigated. Mice treated with fluoxetine in an enriched condition improved their depression-like phenotype compared to controls, displaying higher saccharin preference, higher brain BDNF levels and reduced corticosterone levels. By contrast, when chronic fluoxetine administration occurred in a stressful condition, mice showed a more distinct worsening of the depression-like profile, displaying a faster decrease of saccharin preference, lower brain BDNF levels and increased corticosterone levels. Our findings suggest that the effect of SSRI on depression-like phenotypes in mice is not determined by the drug per se but is induced by the drug and driven by the environment. These findings may be helpful to explain variable effects of SSRI found in clinical practice and to device strategies aimed at enhancing their efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.},

Though studies in animal models have demonstrated that individuals reared in different conditions are differently vulnerable to a stressor of a specific quality, no information is available as to whether such vulnerability differs when facing stressors of different qualities. To this purpose, we reared C57BL/6 male mice either in standard laboratory rearing condition (SN) or in Communal Nest (CN) condition, the latter consisting of a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior until weaning. We scored the amount of interactions with the mother and with peers and found that CN is a form of social enrichment because both these components are significantly increased. At adulthood, we exposed SN and CN mice, for 4 weeks, to either a physical (forced swim) or a social stress (social instability). Immediately before, at week 1 and at week 4 of the stress procedure, corticosterone levels and the hedonic profile were measured. The results show that CN mice are more resilient to social stress than SN mice since they displayed no anhedonia and lower corticosterone levels. By contrast, both experimental groups were similarly vulnerable to physical stress. Overall, our results show that, in male mice, the adult vulnerability to stress changes according to the quality of the stressor, as a function of early experiences. In addition, the stressor to which CN mice are resilient is qualitatively similar to the stimuli they have experienced early on, both concerning the social domain.},

Here we exploited the mouse communal nest (CN) paradigm in order to investigate the effect of the early social environment on the emergence of endophenotypes of depression and on antidepressant efficacy at adulthood. CN, which consists in a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior until weaning, is characterized by high levels of maternal behavior and peer interactions, thus representing an highly stimulating environment. Our results show that, when compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (SN), adult CN mice exhibited greater sucrose preference on the first days of the test, displayed reduced anhedonia during social stress and had lower corticosterone levels after acute and prolonged social stress. Furthermore, in line with previous work, CN displayed longer immobility than SN mice in the forced swim test. Here we show that such behavioral response is differently affected by antidepressants according to early experiences. A 3-week fluoxetine treatment affected only SN mice, leading to an increase of immobility duration up to the levels showed by CN mice, while acute fluoxetine administration decreased immobility duration in both groups. These results show that being reared in a CN profoundly changes developmental trajectories, reducing the adult display of endophenotypes of depression and modifying response to antidepressants. The present findings suggest that early experiences represent one of those factors to be taken into account to identify the appropriate individual pharmacological strategy to treat depression in patients.},

We focus here on the function of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and its phosphorylation by CaMKII in spontaneous learning about reward location in female mice. We show that formation of reward location memory leads to downregulation of PSD-95 protein in dendritic spines of the             stratum radiatum             , area CA1, and selective shrinkage of dendritic spines that contain PSD-95. ShRNA-driven, long-term downregulation of PSD-95 in the area CA1 decreases precision of memory. Autophosphorylation deficient CaMKII mutant mice (CaMKII:T286A) need more time than wild-type animals to learn the location of reward. The same impairment is observed after CA1-targeted overexpression of CaMKII phosphorylation-deficient form of PSD-95 (PSD-95:S73A). In contrast to young adult mice, in aged animals reward location learning affects only spines that lack PSD-95. The frequency and size of the spines without PSD-95 are increased, while shRNA targeted to PSD-95 affects neither speed of learning nor precision of memory indicating alternative mechanisms to support successful memory formation in old mice. Altogether, our data suggest that dynamic regulation of PSD-95 expression is a mechanism that accelerates learning and improves precision of reward location memory in young mice. The function of PSD-95 in memory processes changes in aged animals.},

  abstract = {Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and is implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. The GABAB receptors are G-protein coupled receptors consisting of principle subunits and auxiliary potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) subunits. The KCTD subunits 8, 12, 12b and 16 are cytosolic proteins that determine the kinetics of the GABAB receptor response. Previously, we demonstrated that Kctd12 null mutant mice (Kctd12-/-) exhibit increased auditory fear learning and that Kctd12+/- mice show altered circadian activity, as well as increased intrinsic excitability in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. KCTD16 has been demonstrated to influence neuronal excitability by regulating GABAB receptor-mediated gating of postsynaptic ion channels. In the present study we investigated for behavioural endophenotypes in Kctd16-/- and Kctd16+/- mice. Compared with wild-type (WT) littermates, auditory and contextual fear conditioning were normal in both Kctd16-/- and Kctd16+/- mice. When fear memory was tested on the following day, Kctd16-/- mice exhibited less extinction of auditory fear memory relative to WT and Kctd16+/- mice, as well as more contextual fear memory relative to WT and, in particular, Kctd16+/- mice. Relative to WT, both Kctd16+/- and Kctd16-/- mice exhibited normal circadian activity. This study adds to the evidence that auxillary KCTD subunits of GABAB receptors contribute to the regulation of behaviours that could constitute endophenotypes for hyper-reactivity to aversive stimuli in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {The similarity between sickness behavior syndrome (SBS) in infection and autoimmune disorders and certain symptoms in major depressive disorder (MDD), and the high co-morbidity of autoimmune disorders and MDD, constitutes some of the major evidence for the immune-inflammation hypothesis of MDD. CD40 ligand-CD40 immune-activation is important in host response to infection and in development of autoimmunity. Mice given a single intra-peritoneal injection of CD40 agonist antibody (CD40AB) develop SBS for 2\textendash 3 days characterized by weight loss and increased sleep, effects that are dependent on the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Here we report that CD40AB also induces behavioral effects that extend beyond acute SBS and co-occur with but are not mediated by kynurenine pathway activation and recovery. CD40AB led to decreased saccharin drinking (days 1\textendash 7) and decreased Pavlovian fear conditioning (days 5\textendash 6), and was without effect on physical fatigue (day 5). These behavioral effects co-occurred with increased plasma and brain levels of kynurenine and its metabolites (days 1\textendash 7/8). Co-injection of TNF blocker etanercept with CD40AB prevented each of SBS, reduced saccharin drinking, and kynurenine pathway activation in plasma and brain. Repeated oral administration of a selective indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor blocked activation of the kynurenine pathway but was without effect on SBS and saccharin drinking. This study provides novel evidence that CD40-TNF activation induces deficits in saccharin drinking and Pavlovian fear learning and activates the kynurenine pathway, and that CD40-TNF activation of the kynurenine pathway is not necessary for induction of the acute or extended SBS effects.},

  abstract = {The way animals respond to a stimulus depends largely on an internal comparison between the current sensation and the memory of previous stimuli and outcomes. We know little about the accuracy with which the physical properties of the stimuli influence this type of memorybased discriminative decisions. Research has focused largely on discriminations between stimuli presented in quick succession, where animals can make relative inferences (same or different; higher or lower) from trial to trial. In the current study we used a memory-based task to explore how the stimulus' physical properties, in this case tone frequency, affect auditory discrimination and generalization in mice. Mice performed ad libitum while living in groups in their home quarters. We found that the frequency distance between safe and conditioned sounds had a constraining effect on discrimination. As the safe-to-conditioned distance decreased across groups, performance deteriorated rapidly, even for frequency differences significantly larger than reported discrimination thresholds. Generalization width was influenced both by the physical distance and the previous experience of the mice, and was not accompanied by a decrease in sensory acuity. In conclusion, memory-based discriminations along a single stimulus dimension are inherently hard, reflecting a high overlap between the memory traces of the relevant stimuli. Memory-based discriminations rely therefore on wide sensory filters.},

Herein, aqueous formulations of lecithin nanovesicles are proposed to study three individual trans fatty acids relevant to human nutrition: elaidic acid, trans-vaccenic acid and trans-palmitoleic acid. This proof-of-concept study describes the encapsulation of fatty acids, in vivo bioavailability, and the use of nanovesicles in behavioral experiments. The oral bioavailability of the encapsulated molecules and the selective exposure of animals to each trans-fatty acid of interest were confirmed in healthy rats. Behavioral studies also evidenced that nanovesicles can be used to evaluate the palatability of the lipids and investigate food preferences in mice. Altogether this study shows that lecithin nanovesicles offer an elegant tool to efficiently deliver hydrophobic molecules to animal models. This approach paves the way for future studies deconvoluting the nutritional effects of trans-fatty acids.},

  abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myelin loss in the brain pa\- renchyma. To mimic the disease, mice are fed a cuprizone-supplemented diet for 5 weeks, which leads to demyelination of white and grey matter regions, with the corpus callosum being the most susceptible to cuprizone intoxication. Although this model is highly exploited, classical behavioural tests showed inconsistent results. Objective: In our study, we aimed to use the automated system Intellicage to phenotype the behaviour of cuprizone-fed mice. Methods: Mice were continuously monitored during the 5 weeks of intoxication in their home cages, with minimal interference from the experimenter. Mice were assessed for spontaneous activity, fine movements, and impulsivity. Results: Consistently, cuprizone-fed mice showed reduced activity and impulsivity throughout the test period. These behavioral results were confirmed by repeating the battery of behavioral tests in a second cohort of cuprizone-fed mice. Our results suggest that the behavioural phenotyping of cuprizone-fed mice using Intellicage is reproducible and sensitive enough to detect changes normally missed in standard behavioral test batteries. Conclusion: Using a reproducible and standardized method to assess behavioral changes in mice intoxicated with cuprizone is crucial to better understand the disease as well as the functional outcome of treatments.},

Ideally, behavioral tests improve the predictive validity of studies on animals by mirroring the functional impact of AD-like neuropathology. Learning and memory studies in APP transgenic models have been difficult to replicate. Standardization of procedures, automatization or improved protocol design can improve reproducibility. Here the IntelliCage, an automated system, was used for behavioral testing of APP female transgenic mice with both the Arctic and Swedish mutations, the tgArcSwe model. Protocols covering exploration, operant learning, place learning and extinction of place preference as well as passive avoidance tests were used for longitudinal characterization of behavior. Differences in exploratory activity were significant at four months of age, when plaque-free tg-ArcSwe mice visited less frequently the IntelliCage corners and initially performed fewer visits with licks compared to non-tg animals, inside the new environment. Fourteen months old tg-ArcSwe mice required a longer time to re-habituate to the IntelliCages than non-tg mice. At both ages tg-ArcSwe mice perseverated in place preference extinction test. Fourteen months old tg-ArcSwe mice were impaired in hippocampus-dependent spatial passive avoidance learning. This deficit was found to inversely correlate to calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. Reduced water intake and body weight were observed in 4 months old tg-ArcSwe animals. The body weight difference increased with age. Thus behavioral and metabolic changes in the tg-ArcSwe APP model were detected using the IntelliCage, a system which provides the opportunity for standardized automated longitudinal behavioral phenotyping.},

Recent reports have demonstrated that peripheral inflammation and peripheral immune cells play important roles in the preservation and deterioration of behavior/cognition under various conditions. Indeed, several studies show that the activity of peripheral immune cells can be critical for normal cognitive function. Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cells in the mammalian system. Their activation is critical to the initiation of the inflammatory process and critical for wound healing. Neutrophils are the first cells to be activated and recruited to the central nervous system in both injury and disease. However, our understanding of the role these cells play in behavior and cognition is limited. The present review will summarize what is currently known about the effect the activation of these cells has on various behaviors and cognitive processes.},

Locally blocking c-Fos expression caused a specific behavioral deficit in a sound discrimination task, in parallel with decreased cortical experiencedependent plasticity, without affecting baseline excitability or basic auditory processing. Thus, c-Fos-dependent experiencedependent cortical plasticity is necessary for frequency discrimination in an operant behavioral task.

  abstract = {When faced with sensory stimuli, an organism may be required to detect very small differences in a physical parameter (discrimination), while in other situations it may have to generalize over many possible values of the same physical parameter. This decision may be based both on learned information and on sensory aspects of perception. In the present study we describe frequency processing in the behaving mouse using both discrimination and generalization as two key aspects of behaviour. We used a novel naturalistic behavioural apparatus designed for mice, the Audiobox, and paradigm contingencies that were identical for both auditory discrimination and generalization, the latter measured using latent inhibition. Mice learned to discriminate between frequencies that were an octave apart in a single trial. They showed significant discrimination between tone frequencies that were as close as 4\textendash 7\%, and had d' of about 1 for DF of around 10\%. In contrast, pre-exposure frequencies that were half an octave or less below the conditioned tone elicited latent inhibition, showing a generalization bandwidth of at least half an octave. Thus, in the same apparatus and using the same general memory paradigm, mice showed generalization gradients that were considerably wider than their discrimination threshold, indicating that environmental requirements and previous experience can determine whether the same two frequencies will be considered same or different. Remarkably, generalization gradients paralleled the typical bandwidths established in the auditory periphery and midbrain, suggesting that frequencies may be considered similar when falling within the same critical band.},

Evaluation of this battery in a large number of male and female C57BL/6 wildtype mice, tested in {$>$} 20 independent cohorts, revealed high reproducibility of the behavioral readouts and may serve as future reference tool. We noticed robust sex-specific differences in general activity, cognitive and emotional behavior, but not regarding preference for social pheromones. Specifically, female mice revealed higher activity, decreased sucrose preference, impaired reversal and place-time-reward learning. Furthermore, female mice reacted more sensitively than males to reward-withdrawal showing a negative emotional contrast/ Crespi-effect. In a series of validation experiments, we tested mice with different pathologies, including neuroligin-3 deficient mice (male Nlgn3y/- and female Nlgn3+/-) for autistic behavior, oligodendrocyte-specific erythropoietin receptor knockout (oEpoR-/-) mice for cognitive impairment, as well as mouse models of renal failure (unilateral ureteral obstruction and 5/6 nephrectomy) and of type 2 diabetes (ApoE-/-) \textendash{} for delineating potentially confounding effects of motivational factors (thirst, glucose-craving) on learning and memory assessments. As prominent features, we saw in Nlgn3 mutants reduced preference for social pheromones, whereas oEpoR-/- mice showed learning deficits in place or reversal learning tasks. Renal failure led to increased water intake, and diabetic metabolism to enhanced glucose preference, limiting interpretation of hereon based learning and memory performance in these mice. The phenotyping battery presented here may be well-suited as highthroughput multifaceted diagnostic instrument for translational neuropsychiatry and behavioral genetics.},

Here, we developed and validated a behavioral flexibility test in mice using IntelliCage, a fully automated behavioral analysis system for mice in a group-housed environment. We first developed a ``behavioral sequencing task'' in the IntelliCage that enables us to assess the learning ability of place discrimination and behavioral sequence for reward acquisition. In the serial reversal learning using the task, the discriminated spatial patterns of the rewarded and never-rewarded places were serially reversed, and thus, mice were accordingly expected to realign the previously acquired behavioral sequence. In general, the tested mice showed rapid acquisition of the behavioral sequencing task and behavioral flexibility in the subsequent serial reversal stages both in intra- and inter-session analyses. It was found that essentially the same results were obtained among three different laboratories, which confirm the high stability of the present test protocol in different strains of mice (C57BL/6, DBA/2, and ICR). In particular, the most trained cohort of C57BL/6 mice achieved a markedly rapid adaptation to the reversal task in the final phase of the long-term serial reversal test, which possibly indicated that the mice adapted to the ``reversal rule'' itself. In conclusion, the newly developed behavioral test was shown to be a valid assay of behavioral flexibility in mice, and is expected to be utilized in tests of mouse models of cognitive deficits.},

To address this question, we here investigated higher brain function in mice exposed to dioxin in utero and via lactation by using our recently developed automated behavioral flexibility test and immunohistochemistry of neuronal activation markers Arc, at the 14 brain areas. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were given orally a low dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at a dose of either 0, 0.6 or 3.0 mg/kg on gestation day 12.5. When the pups reached adulthood, they were group-housed in IntelliCage to assess their behavior. As a result, the offspring born to dams exposed to 0.6 mg TCDD/kg were shown to have behavioral inflexibility, compulsive repetitive behavior, and dramatically lowered competitive dominance. In these mice, immunohistochemistry of Arc exhibited the signs of hypoactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hyperactivation of the amygdala. Intriguingly, mice exposed to 3.0 mg/kg were hardly affected in both the behavioral and neuronal activation indices, indicating that the robust, nonmonotonic dose-response relationship. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that perinatal exposure to a low dose of TCDD in mice develops executive function deficits and social behavioral abnormality accompanied with the signs of imbalanced mPFC-amygdala activation.},

  abstract = {Whisker system in rats undergoes rapid development during the first postnatal weeks. Neonatal whisker trim\- ming increases excitability in the somatosensory cortex and affects exploratory behavior at adult ages. WAG/Rij rats are genetically predisposed to develop absence seizures in adulthood, and whisker trimming during three postnatal weeks aggravates epileptic activity in these rats. It is assumed that behavioral performance in adult WAG/Rij rats is influenced (1) by absence epilepsy and (2) by whisker trimming during the short period around the onset of active whisker movements, PN9\textendash 16. We examined the effect of whisker trimming in WAG/Rij rats during PN9\textendash 16 on spike-wave discharges (SWD, EEG hallmark of absence epilepsy). We found that 77\% of WAG/ Rij rats showed pronounced SWD (epileptic phenotype), and the rest did not (non-epileptic phenotype). At the age of 5 m, epileptic trimmed rats showed more SWD than epileptic control rats. Age-related increase of SWD was found only in the control group, suggesting that whisker trimming during PN9\textendash 16 led to an earlier maturation of SWD. Goal-directed behavior was examined in all rats at the age of 4\textendash 4.5 m using IntelliCage impulsivity paradigm. In order to optimize the analysis of behavioral data, we combined several Python packages into a single processing pipeline. Early life whisker trimming altered behavioral sequences and strategy of exploration in adulthood, suggesting reduced whisker sensitivity in the trimmed rats. Epileptic WAG/Rij rats at 4\textendash 4.5 months showed only a slight learning impairment during later stages of IntelliCage impulsivity paradigm, which may be associated with the early stage of development of SWD.},

Here, we studied the consequences of LPAR2 deletion or antagonism on various aspects of cognition using a set of behavioral and electrophysiological analyses. Hippocampal neuronal network activity was decreased in middle-aged L\- PAR2-/- mice, whereas hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was increased suggesting cognitive advantages of \-LPAR2-/- mice. In line with the lower excitability, RNAseq studies revealed reduced transcription of neuronal activity markers in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in na\"ive \-LPAR2-/- mice, including ARC, FOS, FOSB, NR4A, NPAS4 and EGR2. L\- PAR2-/- mice behaved similarly to wildtype controls in maze tests of spatial or social learning and memory but showed faster and accurate responses in a 5-choice serial reaction touchscreen task requiring high attention and fast spatial discrimination. In IntelliCage learning experiments, \-LPAR2-/- were less active during daytime but normally active at night, and showed higher accuracy and attention to LED cues during active times. Overall, they maintained equal or superior licking success with fewer trials. Pharmacological block of the LPAR2 receptor recapitulated the L\- PAR2-/- phenotype, which was characterized by economic corner usage, stronger daytime resting behavior and higher proportions of correct trials. We conclude that LPAR2 stabilizes neuronal network excitability upon aging and allows for more efficient use of resting periods, better memory consolidation and better performance in tasks requiring high selective attention. Therapeutic LPAR2 antagonism may alleviate aging-associated cognitive dysfunctions.},

FOXP1               haploinsufficiency is characterized by autistic behavior, language impairment, and intellectual disability, but feeding difficulties and gastrointestinal problems have also been reported. Whether these are primary impairments, the result of altered eating behavior, or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. To address this question, we investigated               Foxp1               +/-               mice reflecting               FOXP1               haploinsufficiency. These animals show decreased body weight and altered feeding behavior with reduced food and water intake. A pronounced muscular atrophy was detected in the esophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitric oxide-induced relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter was impaired and achalasia was confirmed in vivo by manometry. Foxp1 targets (               Nexn               ,               Rbms3               , and               Wls               ) identified in the brain were dysregulated in the adult               Foxp1               +/-               esophagus. Total gastrointestinal transit was significantly prolonged due to impaired colonic contractility. Our results have uncovered a previously unknown dysfunction (achalasia and impaired gut motility) that explains the gastrointestinal disturbances in patients with FOXP1 syndrome, with potential wider relevance for autism.},

This study explored whether the newly-developed Intellicage system could be used to compare these species in simple spatial learning paradigms. The Intellicage is essentially a group-housing cage that also allows continuous automatic recording of each individual's behaviour. Seven wild-caught bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) were compared with seven wildcaught long-tailed wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in the Intellicage system over 9 days. During the first 90 min after entering the cage, the wood mice were substantially more exploratory than the bank voles (P = 0.003). Over subsequent days, both species showed nocturnal activity increases with voles being 3.7 times more active overall. In the spatial learning paradigms, there were significant species-by-time interactions with wood mice outperforming bank voles on both place learning (P = 0.027) and subsequent reversal (P = 0.006). Conclusions are firstly that the wood mice show superior learning abilities in this paradigm, and secondly that the Intellicage serves as a valuable cognitive testing arena for small wild rodents, or for circumstances where cognition must be compared independent of different responses to handling or novel environments.},

However, the mechanisms by which activity regulates myelination and the extent to which myelin plasticity contributes to non-motor cognitive functions remain incompletely understood. Using a mouse model of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), we recently demonstrated that methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy induces complex glial dysfunction for which microglial activation is central. Here, we demonstrate that remote MTX exposure blocks activity-regulated myelination. MTX decreases cortical Bdnf expression, which is restored by microglial depletion. Bdnf-TrkB signaling is a required component of activity-dependent myelination. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-specific TrkB deletion in chemotherapy-naive mice results in impaired cognitive behavioral performance. A small-molecule TrkB agonist rescues both myelination and cognitive impairment after MTX chemotherapy. This rescue after MTX depends on intact TrkB expression in OPCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism required for adaptive myelination that is aberrant in CRCI due to microglial activation.},

The `expensive brain' (EB) hypothesis posits that the energetic costs of the enlarged brain and the resulting increased cognitive abilities (CA) were met by either increased energy turnover or reduced allocation to other expensive organs, such as the gut. We tested the EB hypothesis by analysing correlated responses to selection in an experimental evolution model system, which comprises line types of laboratory mice selected for high or low basal metabolic rate (BMR), maximum (VO               2max               ) metabolic rates and random-bred (unselected) lines. The traits are implicated in the evolution of homeothermy, having been pre-requisites for the encephalization and exceptional CA of mammals, including humans. High-BMR mice had bigger guts, but not brains, than mice of other line types. Yet, they were superior in the cognitive tasks carried out in both reward and avoidance learning contexts and had higher neuronal plasticity (indexed as the long-term potentiation) than their counterparts. Our data indicate that the evolutionary increase of CA in mammals was initially associated with increased BMR and brain plasticity. It was also fuelled by an enlarged gut, which was not traded off for brain size.},

  abstract = {The reproducibility crisis (or replication crisis) in biomedical research is a particularly existential and under-addressed issue in the field of behavioral neuroscience, where, in spite of efforts to standardize testing and assay protocols, several known and unknown sources of confounding environmental factors add to variance. Human interference is a major contributor to variability both within and across laboratories, as well as novelty-induced anxiety. Attempts to reduce human interference and to measure more "natural" behaviors in subjects has led to the development of automated home-cage monitoring systems. These systems enable prolonged and longitudinal recordings, and provide large continuous measures of spontaneous behavior that can be analyzed across multiple time scales. In this review, a diverse team of neuroscientists and product developers share their experiences using such an automated monitoring system that combines Noldus PhenoTyper               \textregistered{}               home-cages and the video-based tracking software, EthoVision               \textregistered{}               XT, to extract digital biomarkers of motor, emotional, social and cognitive behavior. After presenting our working definition of a ``home-cage'', we compare home-cage testing with more conventional out-of-cage tests (e.g., the open field) and outline the various advantages of the former, including opportunities for within-subject analyses and assessments of circadian and ultradian activity. Next, we address technical issues pertaining to the acquisition of behavioral data, such as the fine-tuning of the tracking software and the potential for integration with biotelemetry and optogenetics. Finally, we provide guidance on which behavioral measures to emphasize, how to filter, segment, and analyze behavior, and how to use analysis scripts. We summarize how the PhenoTyper has applications to study neuropharmacology as well as animal models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric illness. Looking forward, we examine current challenges and the impact of new developments. Examples include the automated recognition of specific behaviors, unambiguous tracking of individuals in a social context, the development of more animal-centered measures of behavior and ways of dealing with large datasets. Together, we advocate that by embracing standardized home-cage monitoring platforms like the PhenoTyper, we are poised to directly assess issues pertaining to reproducibility, and more importantly, measure features of rodent behavior under more ethologically relevant scenarios.},

The functional role of alternative splicing of tau e.g. exon 10 has never been examined in vivo, although genetic studies suggest that it is important to neurodegenerative disease. Results: Gene-targeting was used to delete exon 10 in murine tau on both alleles (E10-/-) to study its functional role. Moreover, mice devoid of exon 10 (E10+/-) on one allele were generated to investigate the effects of 1:1 balanced expression of 4R-/3R-tau protein, since equal amounts of 4R-/3R-tau protein are synthesized in human brain. Middle-aged E10-/- mice displayed sensorimotor disturbances in the rotarod when compared to age-matched E10+/- and wild-type mice, and their muscular grip strength was less than that of E10+/- mice. The performance of E10+/- mice and wild-type mice (E10+/+) was similar in sensorimotor tests. Cognitive abilities or anxiety-like behaviours did not depend on exon 10 in tau, and neither pathological inclusions nor gene-dependent morphological abnormalities were found. Conclusion: Ablation of exon 10 in the murine tau gene alters alternative splicing and tau protein synthesis which results in mild sensorimotor phenotypes with aging. Presumably related microtubule-stabilizing genes rescue other functions.},

In a previous study in mice, we showed that persistent non-goal-directed hyperactivity is a characteristic post-TBI behavior that was associated with low levels of endocannabinoids in the perilesional cortex. We now analyzed lipidome patterns in the brain and plasma in TBI versus sham mice in association with key behavioral parameters and endocannabinoids. Lipidome profiles in the plasma and subcortical ipsilateral and contralateral brain were astonishingly equal in sham and TBI mice, but the ipsilateral perilesional cortex revealed a strong increase in neutral lipids represented by 30 species of triacylglycerols (TGs) of different chain lengths and saturation. The accumulation of TG was localized predominantly to perilesional border cells as revealed by Oil Red O staining. In addition, hexosylceramides (HexCer) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE and ether-linked PE-O) were reduced. They are precursors of gangliosides and endocannabinoids, respectively. High TG, low HexCer, and low PE/PE-O showed a linear association with non-goal-directed nighttime hyperactivity but not with the loss of avoidance memory. The analyses suggest that TG overload and HexCer and PE deficiencies contributed to behavioral dimensions of post-TBI psychopathology.},

It is involved in signaling the hedonic effects of rewards and has essential roles in reinforcement and motivational processes. Here, we focused on opioid signaling through mu and delta receptors on dopaminoceptive neurons and evaluated the role these receptors play in reward-driven behaviors. We generated a genetically modified mouse with selective double knockdown of mu and delta opioid receptors in neurons expressing dopamine receptor D1. Selective expression of the transgene was confirmed using immunostaining. Knockdown was validated by measuring the effects of selective opioid receptor agonists on neuronal membrane currents using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. We found that in the nucleus accumbens of control mice, the majority of dopamine receptor D1-expressing neurons were sensitive to a mu or delta opioid agonist. In mutant mice, the response to the delta receptor agonist was blocked, while the effects of the mu agonist were strongly attenuated. Behaviorally, the mice had no obvious impairments. The mutation did not affect the sensitivity to the rewarding effects of morphine injections or social contact and had no effect on preference for sweet taste. Knockdown had a moderate effect on motor activity in some of the tests performed, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. Thus, we found that knocking down mu and delta receptors on dopamine receptor D1-expressing cells does not appreciably affect some of the reward-driven behaviors previously attributed to opioid signaling.},

  abstract = {Inflammation or injuries of the trigeminal nerve are often associated with persistent facial pain and its sequelae. A number of models have been described to study trigeminal pain in rodents, but the long-lasting behavioral consequences are unknown. This study characterizes the impact of a distal infraorbital nerve injury, called DIONI, which consists of ligature and transection of distal fibers of the infraorbital nerve. We assessed nociception using a conflict paradigm and optogenetics, and a set of reward, aversion, spatial, temporal, and competition tasks in the IntelliCage to study multiple aspects of cognition, circadian rhythms, and social interactions in groups of mice in home cage environments. Mice with DIONI developed cold and mechanical allodynia, and hypersensitivity towards blue light stimulation. They maintained a long-lasting memory of aversive stimuli (airpuff from above), but had no difficulty in learning appetitive tasks, which consisted in developing a preference for a rewarding corner in the IntelliCage. Indeed, they were more strongly ``addicted'' to sugar than sham mice but temporarily failed to relearn the location of rewarding sites after corner switching (reversal learning). They were mildly overactive in some tasks but without disruptions of circadian rhythms or impact on social structure. They adopted a strategy to maintain licking with fewer nosepokes, presumably trying to avoid mechanical stimulation of the snout. The results suggest that mice with DIONI develop strong aversive memories and some cognitive inflexibility, but create adaptive strategies to cope with the persistent trigeminal hypersensitivity.},

  abstract = {Affective and cognitive processing of nociception contributes to the development of chronic pain and vice versa, pain may precipitate psychopathologic symptoms. We hypothesized a higher risk for the latter with immanent neurologic diseases and studied this potential interrelationship in progranulin-deficient mice, which are a model for frontotemporal dementia, a disease dominated by behavioral abnormalities in humans. Young na\"ive progranulin deficient mice behaved normal in tests of short-term memory, anxiety, depression and nociception, but after peripheral nerve injury, they showed attention-deficit and depression-like behavior, over-activity, loss of shelter-seeking, reduced impulse control and compulsive feeding behavior, which did not occur in equally injured controls. Hence, only the interaction of `pain x progranulin deficiency' resulted in the complex phenotype at young age, but neither pain nor progranulin deficiency alone. A deep proteome analysis of the prefrontal cortex and olfactory bulb revealed progranulin-dependent alterations of proteins involved in synaptic transport, including neurotransmitter transporters of the solute carrier superfamily. In particular, progranulin deficiency was associated with a deficiency of nuclear and synaptic zinc transporters (ZnT9/Slc30a9; ZnT3/Slc30a3) with low plasma zinc. Dietary zinc supplementation partly normalized the attention deficit of progranulin-deficient mice, which was in part reminiscent of autism-like and compulsive behavior of synaptic zinc transporter Znt3knockout mice. Hence, the molecular studies point to defective zinc transport possibly contributing to progranulin-deficiency-associated psychopathology. Translated to humans, our data suggest that neuropathic pain may precipitate cognitive and psychopathological symptoms of an inherent, still silent neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract = {Developing reliable mouse models for social behaviour is challenging. Different tests have been proposed, but most of them consist of rather artificial confrontations of unfamiliar mice in novel arenas or are relying on social stress induced by aggressive conspecifics. Natural social interaction in home cage in laboratory has not been investigated well. IntelliCage is a fully automated home-cage system, where activity of the group-housed mice can be monitored along with various cognitive tasks. Here we report the behavioural profile of C57BL/6N (B6) and BALB/c (BALB) female mice in IntelliCage when separated by strain, followed by monitoring of activity and formation of `home-base' after mixing two strains. For that purpose, 3 cages were connected. Significant differences between the strains were established in baseline behaviour in conventional tests and in IntelliCage. The B6 mice showed reduced anxiety-like behaviour in open field and light-dark box, slightly enhanced exploratory activity in IntelliCage during initial adaptation and clearly distinct circadian activity. Mixing of two strains resulted in reduction of body weight and anhedonia in B6 mice. In addition, the B6 mice showed clear preference to previous home-cage, and formed a new home-base faster than BALB mice. In contrast, BALB mice showed enhanced activity and moving between the cages without showing any preference to previous home-cage. It could be argued that social challenge caused changes in both strains and different coping styles are responsible for behavioural manifestations. Altogether, this approach could be useful in modelling and validating mouse models for disorders with disturbed social behaviour.},

We have developed a reversible neurotransmission blocking (RNB) technique, in which neurotransmission of each pathway in the NAc is selectively blocked by specific expression of a transmission -blocking tetanus toxin (D-RNB or I-RNB). In visual cue and reversal tasks in the cross-maze, the NAc direct pathway was critical for learning acquisition. In contrast, the NAc indirect pathway was essential not only for learning flexibility, but also for subsequent acquisition of a new strategy. In place discrimination and serial reversal learning tasks in the IntelliCage, we showed that the NAc indirect pathway controls behavioral flexibility by suppressing the influence of previously correct behavioral strategies during the reversal stage. These basal ganglia circuit mechanisms provide new insight into pathophysiologies associated with compulsive behaviors, including addiction and obesity.}

  abstract = {Behavioral inflexibility has been reported in various psychiatric disorders including drug addiction and schizophrenia. Considerable evidence has demonstrated a critical role for the basal ganglia in the flexibility of behavioral strategies. These processes are guided by the activity of two discrete neuron types, dopamine D1- or D2-receptor expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-/D2-MSNs) in the basal ganglia circuit. We used a reversible neurotransmission blocking technique to examine the role of D1- and D2-MSNs in the acquisition and reversal learning of a place discrimination task in the IntelliCage. We demonstrated that D1- and D2-MSNs do not mediate the acquisition of the task, but that suppression of activity in D2-MSNs impairs reversal learning and increased perseverative errors. Additionally, global knockout of the dopamine D2L receptor isoform produced a similar behavioral phenotype to D2-MSN-blocked mice. We also showed that D2L receptors are necessary for visual discrimination and reversal learning. These results suggest that D2L receptors and D2-MSNs have a critical role in the homeostatic regulation of basal ganglia circuit for flexible behaviors.},

While we cannot control the genes we inherit, we can modify our environment. Understanding the role that social and environmental experiences play in alcohol and sucrose consumption is critical for developing preventative interventions and treatments for alcohol use disorders and obesity. Methods: We used the drinking in the dark two-\-bottle choice (2BC) model of ethanol and sucrose consumption to compare male C57BL/6 mice housed in the IntelliCage (an automated device capable of simultaneously measuring behaviors of up to 16 mice living in an enriched social environment) with mice housed in standard isolated and social environments. Results: Consistent with previous publications on ethanol-\-na\"ive and -\-experienced mice, social and environmental enrichment reduced ethanol preference. Isolated mice had the highest ethanol preference and IntelliCage mice the least, regardless of prior ethanol experience. In mice with no prior sucrose experience, the addition of social and environmental enrichment increased sucrose preference. However, moving isolated mice to enriched conditions did not affect sucrose preference in sucrose-\- experienced mice. Conclusions: The impact of social and environmental enrichment on ethanol consumption differs from sucrose consumption suggesting that interventions and treatments developed for alcohol use disorders may not be suitable for sucrose consumption disorders.},

  abstract = {Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a widespread addiction disorder with severe consequences for health. AUD patients often suffer from sleep disturbances and irregular daily patterns. Conversely, disruptions of circadian rhythms are considered a risk factor for AUD and alcohol relapses. In this study, we investigated the extent to which circadian genetic and environmental disruptions and their interaction alter alcohol drinking behaviour in mice. As a model of genetic circadian disruption, we used Cryptochrome1/2-deficient (Cry1/2\`A/\`A) mice with strongly suppressed circadian rhythms and found that they exhibit significantly reduced preference for alcohol but increased incentive motivation to obtain it. Similarly, we found that low circadian SCN amplitude correlates with reduced alcohol preference in WT mice. Moreover, we show that the low alcohol preference of Cry1/2\`A/\`A mice concurs with high corticosterone and low levels of the orexin precursor prepro-orexin and that WT and Cry1/2\`A/\`A mice respond differently to alcohol withdrawal. As a model of environmentally induced disruption of circadian rhythms, we exposed mice to a ``shift work'' light/dark regimen, which also leads to a reduction in their alcohol preference. Interestingly, this effect is even more pronounced when genetic and environmental circadian perturbations interact in Cry1/2\`A/\`A mice under ``shift work'' conditions. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that in mice, disturbances in circadian rhythms have pronounced effects on alcohol consumption as well as on physiological factors and other behaviours associated with AUD and that the interaction between circadian genetic and environmental disturbances further alters alcohol consumption behaviour.},

Conversely, alternations of circadian rhythms are a risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders. This assumption is supported by animals with clock gene mutations which often display behaviors that resemble human psychiatric disorders. In this study, we performed an indepth behavioral analysis with male mice lacking the central clock genes Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (Cry1/2-/-), which are thus unable to express endogenous circadian rhythms. With wild-type and Cry1/2-/- mice, we performed an extensive behavioral analysis to study their cognitive abilities, social behavior, and their expression of depression-like and anxiety-like behavior. While Cry1/2-/- mice showed only mild abnormalities at cognitive and social behavioral levels, they were consistently more anxious than wildtype mice. Anxiety-like behavior was particularly evident in reduced mobility in new environments, altered ability to habituate, compensatory behavior, and consistent restless behavior across many behavioral tests. In line with their anxiety-like behavioral phenotype, Cry1/2-/- mice have higher cFos activity in the amygdala after exposure to an anxiogenic stressor than wild-type mice. In our study, we identified Cry1/2-/- mice as animals that qualify as a translational mouse model for anxiety disorder in humans because of its consistent behavior of restlessness, increased immobility, and dysfunctional habituation in new environments.},

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of lithium on cell death and proliferation in the hippocampus after irradiation (IR) to the immature brain. Male mice were injected with 2 mmol/kg lithium chloride i.p. on postnatal day 9 (P9) and additional lithium injections, 1 mmol/kg, were administered at 24 h intervals for up to 7 days. BrdU was injected 4 h after lithium injections on P9 and P10. The left hemisphere received a single dose of 8 Gy (MV photons) on P11. The animals were euthanized 6 h or 7 weeks after IR. The number of BrdU-labeled cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the granule cell layer (GCL) 6 h after IR was 24\% higher in the lithium-treated mice. The number of proliferating, phospho-histone H3-positive cells in the SGZ 7 weeks after IR was 59\% higher in the lithium group, so the effect was long-lasting. The number of apoptotic cells in the SGZ 6 h after IR was lower in the lithium group, as judged by 3 different parameters, pyknosis, staining for active caspase-3 and TUNEL. Newly formed cells (BrdU-labeled 1 or 2 days before IR) showed the greatest degree of protection, as judged by 50\% fewer TUNEL-positive cells, whereas non-BrdU-labeled cells showed 38\% fewer TUNEL-positive cells 6 h after IR. Consequently, the growth retardation of the GCL was less pronounced in the lithium group. The number and size of microglia in the DG were also lower in the lithium group, indicating reduced inflammation. Learning was facilitated after lithium treatment, as judged by improved context-dependent fear conditioning, and improved place learning, as judged by assessment in the IntelliCage platform.},

It is often consumed as a substitute for heroin, but imposing itself unknown harms and addictive burdens. Mitragynine is the major psychostimulant constituent of kratom that has recently been reported to induce morphine-like behavioural and cognitive effects in rodents. The effects of chronic consumption on non-drug related behaviours are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic mitragynine treatment on spontaneous activity, rewardrelated behaviour and cognition in mice in an IntelliCage\textregistered{} system, and compared them with those of morphine and {$\Delta$}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We found that chronic mitragynine treatment significantly potentiated horizontal exploratory activity. It enhanced spontaneous sucrose preference and also its persistence when the preference had aversive consequences. Furthermore, mitragynine impaired place learning and its reversal. Thereby, mitragynine effects closely resembled that of morphine and THC sensitisation. These findings suggest that chronic mitragynine exposure enhances spontaneous locomotor activity and the preference for natural rewards, but impairs learning and memory. These findings confirm pleiotropic effects of mitragynine (kratom) on human lifestyle, but may also support the recognition of the drug's harm potential.},

Deletion of a2-chimaerin, but not a1-chimaerin, beginning during early development results in an increase in contextual fear learning in adult mice, whereas learning is not altered when a2-chimaerin is deleted only in adulthood. Our findings suggest that a2-chimaerin acts during development to establish normal cognitive ability in adulthood.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning causes an action that yields a positive outcome more likely to be taken in the future. Here, we investigate how the time elapsed from an action affects subsequent decisions. Groups of C57BL6/J mice were housed in IntelliCages with access to water and chow ad libitum; they also had access to bottles with a reward: saccharin solution, alcohol or a mixture of the two. The probability of receiving a reward in two of the cage corners changed between 0.9 and 0.3 every 48 h over a period of \textasciitilde 33 days. As expected, in most animals, the odds of repeating a corner choice were increased if that choice was previously rewarded. Interestingly, the time elapsed from the previous choice also influenced the probability of repeating the choice, and this effect was independent of previous outcome. Behavioral data were fitted to a series of reinforcement learning models. Best fits were achieved when the reward prediction update was coupled with separate learning rates from positive and negative outcomes and additionally a ``fictitious'' update of the expected value of the nonselected choice. Additional inclusion of a time-dependent decay of the expected values improved the fit marginally in some cases.},

  abstract = {The exact function of the adult brain neurogenesis remains elusive, although it has been suggested to play a role in learning and memory processes. In our studies, we employed cyclin D2 gene knockout (cD2 KO) mice showing impaired neurogenesis as well as decreased hippocampal size. However, irrespectively of the genetic background of cD2 KO mice, this phenotype resulted in neither deficits in the hippocampal-dependent learning ability nor the memory formation. In the present study, cD2 KO mice and control littermates were subjected to hippocampal-dependent behavioral tests with little or no learning component. The knockout mice showed significant impairment in such species-typical behaviors as nest construction, digging, and marble burying. They were building none or poorer nests, digging less robustly, and burying fewer marbles than control mice. Such impairments were previously described, e.g., in animals with hippocampal lesions. Moreover, cD2 KO animals were also more active in the open field and automated motility chamber as well as showed increased explorative behavior in IntelliCage. Both increased motility and explorative behaviors were previously observed in hippocampally lesioned animals. Finally, cD2 KO mice showed normal sucrose preference, however starting from the second exposure to the sweetened solution, while control animals displayed a strong preference immediately. Presented results suggest that either morphological abnormalities of the hippocampal formation or adult brain neurogenesis impairment (or both) alter hippocampal-dependent behaviors of mutant mice without influencing learning abilities. These results may also suggest that adult brain neurogenesis is involved in species-typical behaviors.},

  abstract = {Background: Besides the well-known effects of ghrelin on adiposity and food intake regulation, the ghrelin system has been shown to regulate aspects of behavior including anxiety and stress. However, the effect of virus-mediated overexpression of the ghrelin receptor in the amygdala has not previously been addressed directly. Methods: First, we examined the acute effect of peripheral ghrelin administration on anxiety- and depression-like behavior using the open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim, and tail suspension tests. Next, we examined the effect of peripheral ghrelin administration and ghrelin receptor deficiency on stress in a familiar and social environment using the Intellicage system. Importantly, we also used a novel approach to study ghrelin receptor signaling in the brain by overexpressing the ghrelin receptor in the amygdala. We examined the effect of ghrelin receptor overexpression on anxiety-related behavior before and after acute stress and measured the modulation of serotonin receptor expression. Results: We found that ghrelin caused an anxiolytic-like effect in both the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Additionally, it attenuated air-puff\textendash induced stress in the social environment, while the opposite was shown in ghrelin receptor deficient mice. Finally, we found that overexpression of the ghrelin receptor in the basolateral division of the amygdala caused an anxiolytic-like effect and decreased the 5HT1a receptor expression. Conclusions: Ghrelin administration and overexpression of the ghrelin receptor in the amygdala induces anxiolytic-like behavior. Since the ghrelin receptor has high constitutive activity, ligand-independent signaling in vivo may be important for the observed anxiolytic-like effects. The anxiolytic effects seem to be mediated independently from the HPA axis, potentially engaging the central serotonin system.},

Although the gene is ubiquitously expressed affected individuals present no consistent clinical features beyond ID. In order to study the pathological mechanism involved in the aetiology of FTSJ1 deficiency-related cognitive impairment, we generated and characterized an Ftsj1 deficient mouse line based on the gene trapped stem cell line RRD143. Apart from an impaired learning capacity these mice presented with several statistically significantly altered features related to behaviour, pain sensing, bone and energy metabolism, the immune and the hormone system as well as gene expression. These findings show that Ftsj1 deficiency in mammals is not phenotypically restricted to the brain but affects various organ systems. Re-examination of ID patients with FTSJ1 mutations from two previously reported families showed that several features observed in the mouse model were recapitulated in some of the patients. Though the clinical spectrum related to Ftsj1 deficiency in mouse and man is variable, we suggest that an increased pain threshold may be more common in patients with FTSJ1 deficiency. Our findings demonstrate novel roles for Ftsj1 in maintaining proper cellular and tissue functions in a mammalian organism.},

  abstract = {Impulsivity is a personality trait of healthy individuals, but in extreme forms common in mental disorders. Previous behavioral testing of wild-caught bank voles and wood mice suggested impulsiveness in bank voles. Here, we compared behavioral performance of bank voles and wood mice in tests for response control in the IntelliCage. In the reaction time task, a test similar to the five-choice serial-reaction time task (5CSRTT), bank voles made more premature responses. Impulsivity in the reaction time task was associated with smaller medial habenular nucleus in bank voles. Additional tests revealed reduced behavioral flexibility in the selfpaced flexibility task in bank voles, but equal spatial and reversal learning in the chaining/reversal task in both species. Expression of immediate early gene Arc after behavioral testing was low in medial prefrontal cortex, but high in hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus in bank voles. Wood mice showed the opposite pattern. Numbers of Arc-positive cells in the dorsal hippocampus were higher in bank voles than wood mice. Due to continuous behavioral testing (24/7), associations between behavioral performance and Arc were rare. Corticosterone measurements at the end of experiments suggested that IntelliCage testing did not elicit a stress response in these wild rodents. In summary, habenular size differences and altered activation of brain areas after testing might indicate differently balanced activations of cortico-limbic and cortico-hypothalamic circuits in bank voles compared to wood mice. Behavioral performance of bank voles suggest that these rodents could be a natural animal model for investigating impulsive and perseverative behaviors.\'O 2022 The Author(s).

While money is the common denominator to assess the value of goods in humans, it appears difficult at first glance to put a price tag on the decisions of laboratory animals. Here we used consumer demand tests to measure how much work female mice expend to obtain access to different liquids. The mice could each choose between two liquids, one of which was free. The amount of work required to access the other liquid, by contrast, increased daily. In this way, the value of the liquid can be determined from a mouse's microeconomic perspective. The unique feature is that our test was carried out in a home-cage based setup. The mice lived in a group but could individually access the test-cage, which was connected to the home-cage via a gate. Thereby the mice were able to perform their task undisturbed by group members and on a self-chosen schedule with minimal influence by the experimenter. Our results show that the maximum number of nosepokes depends on the liquids presented. Mice worked incredibly hard for access to water while a bitter-tasting solution was offered for free whereas they made less nosepokes for sweetened liquids while water was offered for free. The results demonstrate that it is possible to perform automated and home-cage based consumer demand tests in order to ask the mice not only what they like best but also how strong their preference is.},

Moreover, most experiments use relatively young mice in the range of late adolescence to early adulthood. As a consequence, little is known about the day-to-day life of adult and aged laboratory mice. Here we present a long-term data set with three consecutive phases conducted with the same male mice over their lifetime in order to shed light on possible long-term effects of repeated cognitive stimulation. One third of the animals was trained by a variety of learning tasks conducted up to an age of 606 days. The mice were housed in four cages with 12 animals per cage; only four mice per cage had to repeatedly solve cognitive tasks for getting access to water using the IntelliCage system. In addition, these learner mice were tested in standard cognitive tests outside their home-cage. The other eight mice served as two control groups living in the same environment but without having to solve tasks for getting access to water. One control group was additionally placed on the test set-ups without having to learn the tasks. Next to the cognitive tasks, we took physiological measures (body mass, resting metabolic rate) and tested for dominance behavior, and attractivity in a female choice experiment. Overall, the mice were under surveillance until they died a natural death, providing a unique data set over the course of virtually their entire lives. Our data showed treatment differences during the first phase of our lifetime data set. Young learner mice showed a higher activity, less growth and resting metabolic rate, and were less attractive for female mice. These effects, however, were not preserved over the long-term. We also did not find differences in dominance or effects on longevity. However, we generated a unique and valuable set of long-term behavioral and physiological data from a single group of male mice and note that our long-term data contribute to a better understanding of the behavioral and physiological processes in male C57Bl/6J mice.},

  abstract = {Radiotherapy in the treatment of pediatric brain tumors is often associated with debilitating late-appearing adverse effects, such as intellectual impairment. Areas in the brain harboring stem cells are particularly sensitive to irradiation (IR) and loss of these cells may contribute to cognitive deficits. It has been demonstrated that IR-induced inflammation negatively affects neural progenitor differentiation. In this study, we used mice lacking the third complement component (C3-/-) to investigate the role of complement in a mouse model of IR-induced injury to the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampus. C3-/- and wild type (WT) mice received a single, moderate dose of 8 Gy to the brain on postnatal day 10. The C3-/- mice displayed 55 \% more microglia (Iba-1+) and a trend towards increase in proliferating cells in the GCL compared to WT mice 7 days after IR. Importantly, months after IR C3/- mice made fewer errors than WT mice in a reversal learning test indicating better learning capacity in C3-/- mice after IR. Notably, months after IR C3-/- and WT mice had similar GCL volumes, survival of newborn cells (BrdU), microglia (Iba-1) and astrocyte (S100{$\beta$}) numbers in the GCL. In summary, our data show that the complement system contributes to IR-induced loss of proliferating cells and maladaptive inflammatory responses in the acute phase after IR, leading to impaired learning capacity in adulthood. Targeting the complement system is hence promising for future strategies to reduce the long-term adverse consequences of IR in the young brain.},

These complications include intellectual and memory impairments as well as perturbed growth and puberty. We investigated the long-term effects of a single 8 Gy irradiation dose to the brains of 14-day-old mice. Behavior was assessed one year after irradiation using IntelliCage and open field, followed by immunohistochemical investigation of proliferation and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We found a 61\% reduction in proliferation and survival (BrdU incorporation 4 weeks prior to sacrifice), 99\% decrease in neurogenesis (number of doublecortin-positive cells) and gliosis (12\% higher astrocyte density) one year following irradiation. Irradiated animals displayed increased activity in a novel environment but decreased activity in their home cage. Place learning in the IntelliCage was unaffected by irradiation but reversal learning was impaired. Irradiated animals persevered in visiting previously correct corners to a higher extent compared to control animals. Hence, despite the virtual absence of neurogenesis in these old mice, spatial learning could take place. Reversal learning however, where a previous memory was replaced with a new one, was partly impaired. This model is useful to study the so called late effects of radiotherapy to the young brain and to evaluate possible interventions.},

A family of BD and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) caused by a mutation of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1, SLC25A4) implicated that ANT1 mutations confer a risk of BD. Here, we sequenced ANT1 in 324 probands of NIMH bipolar disorder pedigrees and identified two BD patients carrying heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. Behavioral analysis of brain specific Ant1 heterozygous conditional knockout (cKO) mice using lntelliCage showed a selective diminution in delay discounting. Delay discounting is the choice of smaller but immediate reward than larger but delayed reward and an index of impulsivity. Diminution of delay discounting suggests an increase in serotonergic activity. This finding was replicated by a 5-choice serial reaction time test. An anatomical screen showed accumulation of COX (cytochrome c oxidase) negative cells in dorsal raphe. Dorsal raphe neurons in the heterozygous cKO showed hyperexcitability, along with enhanced serotonin turnover in the nucleus accumbens and upregulation of Maob in dorsal raphe. These findings altogether suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction as the genetic risk of BD may cause vulnerability to BD by altering serotonergic neurotransmission.},

  abstract = {Personalized medicine intensifies interest in experimental paradigms that delineate sources of phenotypic variation. The paradigm of environmental enrichment allows for comparisons among differently housed labo\- ratory rodents to unravel environmental effects on brain plasticity and related phenotypes. We have developed a new longitudinal variant of this paradigm, which allows to investigate the emergence of individuality, the divergence of individual behavioral trajectories under a constant genetic background and in a shared environ\- ment. We here describe this novel method, the ``Individuality Paradigm,'' which allows to investigate mecha\- nisms that drive individuality. Various aspects of individual activity are tracked over time to identify the contribution of the non-shared environment, that is the extent to which the experience of an environment differs between individual members of a population. We describe the design of this paradigm in detail, lay out its scientific potential beyond the published studies and discuss how it differs from other approaches to study in\- dividuality. The custom-built cage system, commercially marketed as ``ColonyRack'', allows mice to roam freely between 70 cages through connector tubes equipped with ring antennas that detect each animal's ID from an RFID transponder implanted in the animal's neck. The system has a total floor area of 2.74 m2 and its spatial resolution corresponds to the size of the individual cages. Spatiotemporally resolved antenna contacts yield longitudinal measures of individual behavior, including the powerful measure of roaming entropy (RE). The Individuality Paradigm provides a rodent model of the making of individuality and the impact of the `non-shared' environment on life-course development.},

Hence, in the present study, we examined the effects of in utero and lactational exposure to brominated dibenzofurans on infant and adult offspring behavior to understand the mechanism of PBDD/DFs toxicity and detect effective behavioral endpoints in DNT assessment. We analyzed the behavior of mouse offspring born to dams administered 2,3,7,8tetrabromodibenzofuran (2,3,7,8-TeBDF; dose of 0, 9, or 45 {$\mu$}g/kg) or 2,3,8-tribromodibenzofuran (2,3,8-TrBDF; dose of 0, 75.6, or 378 {$\mu$}g/kg) on gestational day 12.5. In mouse offspring born to dams exposed to 2,3,7,8TeBDF, the exploratory behavior in a novel environment in adulthood and ultrasonic vocalization (USV) during infancy were significantly reduced. Additionally, AhR-target genes, such as Cyp1a1, were induced in the liver of 2,3,7,8-TeBDF-exposed offspring in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, no significant changes in the infant and adult behaviors and expression level of AhR-target genes were observed in the 2,3,8-TrBDF-exposed offspring. These results suggest that 2,3,7,8-TeBDF can induce DNT and that the analysis of exploratory behavior in a novel environment and USV may be useful endpoints to assess DNT of dioxin-related substances.},

  abstract = {The habenular complex linking forebrain and midbrain structures is subdivided into the medial (mHb) and the lateral nuclei (lHb). The mHb is characterized by the expression of specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor isoforms and the release of acetylcholine to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), the sole output region of the mHb. The specific function of this circuit, however, is poorly understood. Here we generated transgenic mice in which mHb cells were selectively ablated postnatally. These lesions led to large reductions in acetylcholine levels within the IPN. The mutant mice exhibited abnormalities in a wide range of behavioral domains. They tended to be hyperactive during the early night period and were maladapted when repeatedly exposed to new environments. Mutant mice also showed a high rate of premature responses in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), indicating impulsive and compulsive behavior. Additionally, mice also exhibited delay and effort aversion in a decision-making test, deficits in spatial memory, a subtle increase in anxiety levels, and attenuated sensorimotor gating. IntelliCage studies under social housing conditions confirmed hyperactivity, environmental maladaptation, and impulsive/compulsive behavior, delay discounting, deficits in long-term spatial memory, and reduced flexibility in complex learning paradigms. In 5-CSRTT and adaptation tasks, systemic administration of nicotine slowed down nose-poke reaction and enhanced adaptation in control but not mutant mice. These findings demonstrate that the mHb\textendash IPN pathway plays a crucial role in inhibitory control and cognition-dependent executive functions.},

We tested the directionality of the evolutionary trade-off between brain, gut and CA using experimental evolution model consisting of lines of laboratory mice subjected to artificial selection on basal (BMR) or maximum (VO2max) aerobic metabolism - traits that are implicated in evolution of homeothermy and CA. High BMR mice had bigger guts, but not brains. Yet, they performed better in cognitively demanding tasks and had higher neuronal plasticity than their counterparts. The data indicate that evolutionary increase of CA was initially associated with brain plasticity and fuelled by an enlarged gut, which was not traded off for brain size, as the ET posits.},

The model was based on voluntary intermittent access to increasing concentrations of alcohol. We aimed to establish a model of alcohol craving and used an extinction test on withdrawal days 1 and 10 to study motivation for alcohol. For this purpose, the alcohol drinking training was paired with light cues to establish conditioning. The extinction test was carried out without alcohol but in the presence of light cues and empty bottles. The outcome measures were number of visits, nosepokes, and licks in the conditioned corner where the number of nosepokes represents how much mice ``want'' alcohol and number of licks shows how much mice ``like'' alcohol. The number of nosepokes during withdrawal is a measure of craving. Late withdrawal craving was found when intermittent alcohol access was carried out in the automated cages. In this case, we observed a significant increase in the number of nosepokes on both withdrawal days 1 and 10 as compared to water control. The number of nosepokes in the withdrawal days did not correlate with alcohol dose, but number of nosepokes on withdrawal day 1 correlated with the number of nosepokes on the last training day. Although we did not observe incubation of alcohol craving after withdrawal, the craving was increased at the late time point. We conclude that we have established a new tool to study alcohol drinking behavior and craving in female mice.},

To study motivation to drink alcohol, we carried out the extinction tests on withdrawal days 1 (WD1) and 10 (WD10). During tests, the light cues were present in conditioned corners, but there was no liquid in the bottles. Results: We found that the number of visits and nosepokes in the CS+ corner in the alcohol group was much higher than in the water group. Also, during training, the consumption of alcohol was increasing. In the extinction tests, we found that the number of nosepokes in the CS+ corner increased in the alcohol group on both WD1 and WD10.

Here, we studied the role of GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) on alcohol-seeking behavior in group-housed female mice. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We modeled alcohol-seeking behavior in C57Bl/6J female mice. The behavioral experiments in grouphoused female mice were performed in an automated IntelliCage system. We conducted RT-qPCR analysis of Gdnf, Bdnf, Manf and Cdnf expression in different areas of the female mouse brain after alcohol drinking conditioning. We injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing human GDNF or BDNF in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) after ten days of alcohol drinking conditioning and assessed alcohol-seeking behavior. Behavioral data were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, and statistically significant effects were followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. The student's t-test was used to analyze qPCR data. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The RT-qPCR data showed that Gdnf mRNA level in NAc was more than four times higher (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) in the mice from the sweetened alcohol group compared to the water group. Our data showed a more than a two-fold decrease in Manf mRNA (p\,=\,0.04) and Cdnf mRNA (p\,=\,0.02) levels in the hippocampus and Manf mRNA in the VTA (p\,=\,0.04) after alcohol consumption. Two-fold endogenous overexpression of Gdnf mRNA and lack of CDNF did not affect alcohol-seeking behavior. The AVV-GDNF overexpression in nucleus accumbens suppressed alcohol-seeking behavior while overexpression of BDNF did not. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The effect of increased endogenous Gdnf mRNA level in female mice upon alcohol drinking has remained unknown. Our data suggest that an increase in endogenous GDNF expression upon alcohol drinking occurs in response to the activation of another mesolimbic reward pathway participant.},

However, existing models are often limited in their translational value due to Tau overexpression, and the frequent occurrence of motor deficits which prevent comprehensive behavioural assessments. In order to address these limitations, a forebrainspecific (CaMKII{$\alpha$} promoter), human mutated Tau (hTauP301L + R406W) knock-in mouse was generated out of the previously characterised PLB1Triple mouse, and named PLB2Tau. After confirmation of an additional hTau species (\textasciitilde 60 kDa) in forebrain samples, we identified age-dependent progressive Tau phosphorylation which coincided with the emergence of FTD relevant behavioural traits. In line with the non-cognitive symptomatology of FTD, PLB2Tau mice demonstrated early emerging (\textasciitilde 6 months) phenotypes of heightened anxiety in the elevated plus maze, depressive/apathetic behaviour in a sucrose preference test and generally reduced exploratory activity in the absence of motor impairments. Investigations of cognitive performance indicated prominent dysfunctions in semantic memory, as assessed by social transmission of food preference, and in behavioural flexibility during spatial reversal learning in a home cage corner-learning task. Spatial learning was only mildly affected and task-specific, with impairments at 12 months of age in the corner learning but not in the water maze task. Electroencephalographic (EEG) investigations indicated a vigilance-stage specific loss of alpha power during wakefulness at both parietal and prefrontal recording sites, and site-specific EEG changes during non-rapid eye movement sleep (prefrontal) and rapid eye movement sleep (parietal). Further investigation of hippocampal electrophysiology conducted in slice preparations indicated a modest reduction in efficacy of synaptic transmission in the absence of altered synaptic plasticity.},

Activity pattern and spatial conditioning performance differed consistently between strains, i.e. exhibited no interaction with the between-laboratory factor, whereas the gross laboratory effect showed up significantly in the majority of measures. It is argued that overall differences between laboratories may not realistically be preventable, as subtle differences in animal housing and treatment will not be controllable, in practice. However, consistency of strain (or treatment) effects appears to be far more important in behavioral and brain sciences than the absolute overall level of such measures. In this respect, basic behavioral and learning measures proved to be highly consistent in the IntelliCage, therefore providing a valid basis for meaningful research hypothesis testing. Also, potential heterogeneity of behavioral status because of environmental and social enrichment has no detectable negative effect on the consistency of strain effects. We suggest that the absence of human interference during behavioral testing is the most prominent advantage of the IntelliCage and suspect that this is likely responsible for the between-laboratory consistency of findings, although we are aware that this ultimately needs direct testing.},

The pro-autophagy effects help to remove pathological proteins and thereby prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Enhancing autophagy also contributes to the resolution of neuropathic pain in mice. Therefore, we here assessed the effects of continuous trehalose administration via drinking water using the mouse Spared Nerve Injury model of neuropathic pain. Trehalose had no effect on drinking, feeding, voluntary wheel running, motor coordination, locomotion, and open field, elevated plus maze, and Barnes Maze behavior, showing that it was well tolerated. However, trehalose reduced nerve injury-evoked nociceptive mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity as compared to vehicle. Trehalose had no effect on calcium currents in primary somatosensory neurons, pointing to central mechanisms of the antinociceptive effects. In IntelliCages, trehalose-treated mice showed reduced activity, in particular, a low frequency of nosepokes, which was associated with a reduced proportion of correct trials and flat learning curves in place preference learning tasks. Mice failed to switch corner preferences and stuck to spontaneously preferred corners. The behavior in IntelliCages is suggestive of sedative effects as a ``side effect'' of a continuous protracted trehalose treatment, leading to impairment of learning flexibility. Hence, trehalose diet supplements might reduce chronic pain but likely at the expense of alertness.},

Here we found, using immunohistochemistry of wild-type and CD73 deficient mice, that CD73 is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia core comprised of striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and globus pallidus. Furthermore, meninges and the olfactory tubercle were found to specifically express CD73. Analysis of wild type (wt) and CD73 deficient mice revealed that CD73 confers the majority of 5'-nucleotidase activity in several areas of the brain. In a battery of behavioural tests and in IntelliCage studies, the CD73 deficient mice demonstrated significantly enhanced exploratory locomotor activity, which probably reflects the prominent expression of CD73 in striatum and globus pallidus that are known to control locomotion. Furthermore, the CD73 deficient mice displayed altered social behaviour. Overall, our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into adenosinergic signalling in brain, which is implicated in the regulation of normal and pathological behaviour.},

C57BL/6 and DBA/2 female mice displaying multiple differences in cognitive, social, and emotional behavior were group-housed either in same-strain or in mixed-strain conditions. Comprehensive behavioral phenotyping and analysis of expression of several plasticity- and stress-related genes were done to measure the reciprocal effects of social interaction between the strains. Contrary to our expectation, mixed housing did not change the behavior of DBA/2 mice. Nevertheless, the level of serum corticosterone and the expression of glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 in the brain were increased in mixed housed DBA/2 as compared with those of separately housed DBA/2 mice. In contrast, socially active C57BL/6 animals were more sensitive to the mixed housing, displaying several signs of stress: alterations in learning, social, and anxiety-like behavior and anhedonia. These behavioral impairments were accompanied by the elevated serum corticosterone and the reduced expression of Nr3c1, as well as the elevated Bdnf levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Our results demonstrate the importance of social factors in modulation of both behavior and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms in stress response, and draw attention to the potential negative impact of social interventions for individuals involved in social support.},

  abstract = {In Huntington's disease (HD) patients and in model organisms, messenger RNA transcriptome has been extensively studied; in contrast, comparatively little is known about expression and potential role of microRNAs. Using RNA-sequencing, we have quantified microRNA expression in four brain regions and liver, at three different ages, from an allelic series of HD model mice with increasing CAG length in the endogenous Huntingtin gene. Our analyses reveal CAG length-dependent microRNA expression changes in brain, with 159 microRNAs selectively altered in striatum, 102 in cerebellum, 51 in hippocampus, and 45 in cortex. In contrast, a progressive CAG length-dependent microRNA dysregulation was not observed in liver. We further identify microRNAs whose transcriptomic response to CAG length expansion differs significantly among the brain regions and validate our findings in data from a second, independent cohort of mice. Using existing mRNA expression data from the same animals, we assess the possible relationships between microRNA and mRNA expression and highlight candidate microRNAs that are negatively correlated with, and whose predicted targets are enriched in, CAG-length dependent mRNA modules. Several of our top microRNAs (Mir212/Mir132, Mir218, Mir128 and others) have been previously associated with aspects of neuronal development and survival. This study provides an extensive resource for CAG length-dependent changes in microRNA expression in diseasevulnerable and -resistant brain regions in HD mice, and provides new insights for further investigation of microRNAs in HD pathogenesis and therapeutics.},

Although cAMP-GEF II is expressed abundantly in several brain areas including the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, its specific function and possible role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes remain elusive. Here, we investigated how cAMP-GEF II affects synaptic function and animal behavior using cAMP-GEF II knockout mice. Results: We found that deletion of cAMP-GEF II induced moderate decrease in long-term potentiation, although this decrease was not statistically significant. On the other hand, it produced a significant and clear impairment in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of hippocampus, while microscopic morphology, basal synaptic transmission, and depotentiation were normal. Behavioral testing using the Morris water maze and automated IntelliCage system showed that cAMP-GEF II deficient mice had moderately reduced behavioral flexibility in spatial learning and memory. Conclusions: We concluded that cAMP-GEF II plays a key role in hippocampal functions including behavioral flexibility in reversal learning and in mechanisms underlying induction of long-term depression.},

A common problem in behavioral phenotyping of mice is that genetic differences are inconsistent across laboratories. This is partially due to uncontrollable interactions between experimenter, variations of experimental set-up and variable stress reactions of mice being exposed singly to a variety of stimuli and situations. Here we compare mice that have been raised under identical conditions but then tested in two different laboratories for exploratory behavior and spatial learning, first by manual testing using identical test set-ups, and then in the automated INTELLICAGE. The data presented here illustrate that automated testing provides much more consistent data across laboratories, and they show that INTELLICAGE measures at least partially the same behavioral traits as observed in standard tests of mouse exploratory behavior and spatial learning.},

  abstract = {Translational research in behavioral neuroscience seeks causes and remedies for human mental health problems in animals, following leads imposed by clinical research in psychiatry. This endeavor faces several problems because scientists must read and interpret animal movements to represent human perceptions, mood, and memory processes. Yet, it is still not known how mammalian brains bundle all these processes into a highly compressed motor output in the brain stem and spinal cord, but without that knowledge, translational research remains aimless. Based on some four decades of experience in the field, the article identifies sources of interpretation problems and illustrates typical translational pitfalls. (1) The sensory world of mice is different. Smell, hearing, and tactile whisker sensations dominate in rodents, while visual input is comparatively small. In humans, the relations are reversed. (2) Mouse and human brains are equated inappropriately: the association cortex makes up a large portion of the human neocortex, while it is relatively small in rodents. The predominant associative cortex in rodents is the hippocampus itself, orchestrating chiefly inputs from secondary sensorimotor areas and generating species-typical motor patterns that are not easily reconciled with putative human hippocampal functions. (3) Translational interpretation of studies of memory or emotionality often neglects the ecology of mice, an extremely small species surviving by freezing or flight reactions that do not need much cognitive processing. (4) Further misinterpretations arise from confounding neuronal properties with system properties, and from rigid mechanistic thinking unaware that many experimentally induced changes in the brain do partially reflect unpredictable compensatory plasticity. (5) Based on observing hippocampal lesion effects in mice indoors and outdoors, the article offers a simplistic general model of hippocampal functions in relation to hypothalamic input and output, placing hypothalamus and the supraspinal motor system at the top of a cerebral hierarchy. (6) Many translational problems could be avoided by inclusion of simple species-typical behaviors as end-points comparable to human cognitive or executive processing, and to rely more on artificial intelligence for recognizing patterns not classifiable by traditional psychological concepts.},

  abstract = {Ulcerative colitis is a condition characterised by the infiltration of leukocytes into the gastrointestinal wall. Leukocyte-MPO catalyses hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) formation from chloride (Cl-) and thiocyanous (SCN-) anions, respectively. While HOCl indiscriminately oxidises biomolecules, HOSCN primarily targets low-molecular weight protein thiols. Oxidative damage mediated by HOSCN may be reversible, potentially decreasing MPO-associated host tissue destruction. This study investigated the effect of SCN- supplementation in a model of acute colitis. Female mice were supplemented dextran sodium sulphate (DSS, 3\% w/v) in the presence of 10 mM Cl- or SCN- in drinking water ad libitum, or with salts (NaCl and NaSCN only) or water only (controls). Behavioural studies showed mice tolerated NaSCN and NaCl-treated water with water-seeking frequency. Ion-exchange chromatography showed increased fecal and plasma SCN- levels in thiocyanate supplemented mice; plasma SCN- reached similar fold-increase for smokers. Overall there was no difference in weight loss and clinical score, mucin levels, crypt integrity and extent of cellular infiltration between DSS/SCN- and DSS/Cl- groups. Neutrophil recruitment remained unchanged in DSS-treated mice, as assessed by fecal calprotectin levels. Total thiol and tyrosine phosphatase activity remained unchanged between DSS/Cl- and DSS/SCN- groups, however, colonic tissue showed a trend in decreased 3-chlorotyrosine (1.5-fold reduction, p {$<$} 0.051) and marked increase in colonic GCLC, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. These data suggest that SCN- administration can modulate MPO activity towards a HOSCN-specific pathway, however, this does not alter the development of colitis within a DSS murine model.},

One month after TBI, deficits in place learning and cognitive flexibility in reverse learning were clearly detectable in IntelliCages and these memory deficits correlated with the initial trauma severity on the functional neuroscore. While sucrose preference or its extinction were not influenced by TBI, traumatized mice performed significantly worse in a complex episodic memory learning task. In consecutive locomotor and forepaw skilled use tests, posttraumatic hyperactivity and impairment of contralateral paw use were evident. Analysis of cellular reactions to TBI three months after injury in selected defined regions of interest in the immediate lesion, ipsi- and contralateral frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus revealed a persistent microgliosis and astrogliosis which were accom\- panied by iron-containing macrophages and myelin degradation in the lesion area as well as with axonal damage in the neighboring cortical regions. Microglial and astroglial reactions in cortex showed a positive correlation with the initial trauma severity and a negative correlation with the spatial and episodic memory indicating a role of brain inflammatory reactions in posttraumatic memory deficits.},

Psycho- and immunopathology closely interrelated: pathological changes in the functioning of both systems occur simultaneously and are interdependent. Depression, as a mental disorder, is a major public health concern. The estimations are showing rise of the depression's incidence in the future. However, currently used therapy of depression doesn't provide a complete cure. It is known that a violation of neuroimmune interaction is an essential link in the pathogenesis of the disease, having a negative impact on its course, making the clinical picture worse, reducing effectiveness of the therapy, therefore, it's urgent to search for a new treatment approaches. There are a sufficient amount data on the immune cells and their biologically active products leading role in the pathogenesis of depression. The unidirectional effect of most psychoactive substances on the central nervous system and the immune system confirms intersystem mutual regulation and allows considering the immune cells as model objects for influencing the intersystem functional relationship; so, cells immunotherapy can be the method of choice in the treatment of depressive disorders. We first demonstrated the possibility of animal's behavior directed regulation by the transplantation of immune cells with definite functional characteristics, including those with functional activity modulated extracorporeally by a psychoactive substance. Based on the previous results we investigated the effect of the in vitro caffeine- treated immune cells on the behavior and immune phenotypes in depressive-like singeneic recipients. Transplantation of caffeine-treated splenocytes from depressive-like donors has been shown to induce depressive-like behavior editing in syngeneic recipients, which was manifested in anhedonia decrease, stimulation of exploratory behavior in the Open Field test and motor activity in the Porsolt forced swimming test. Recipient's behavioral changes were registered on the background of decreased brain pro- inflammatory cytokines (TNF{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IFN{$\gamma$}) and IL-10 increased in some pathogenetically significant for depressive-like state brain structures (hippocampus, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, striatum), which indicates a decrease in neuroinflammation. It was also detected recipient's immune system functional activity modulation. The cytokines-mediated mechanisms of depressive-like behavior editing by the in vitro caffeine- modulated immune cells are discussed.},

As patients with schizophrenia often show perseverant behaviours and lack of behavioural flexibility, it is important to know whether the effect of haloperidol makes these traits worse. This study, therefore, was designed to evaluate the effects of haloperidol on the learning performance of mice using an automated home cage environment, the IntelliCage. Behavioural shuttling in the IntelliCage enabled us to assess learning in tasks including place discrimination learning and reversal place learning. In reversal place learning, spatial patterns of rewarded and non-rewarded places that mice had learned to discriminate were reversed, and the adaptability of mice to change the previously acquired place learning was measured.

  abstract = {Fluoxetine is a clinically successful antidepressant. It is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) stereoisomers. In preclinical studies, chronic treatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) had antidepressant effects correlated with increased hippocampal cell proliferation in adult rodents. However, the contribution of the enantiomers of fluoxetine is largely unknown. We investigated the effects of treatment with (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine on cognitive behavioral paradigms and examined cell proliferation in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J female mice. In a behavioral sequencing task using the IntelliCage system in which discriminated spatial patterns of rewarded and never-rewarded corners were reversed serially, (R)-fluoxetine-treated mice showed rapid acquisition of behavioral sequencing (compared with S-fluoxetine) and cognitive flexibility in subsequent reversal stages in intra- and intersession analysis. (R)-fluoxetine also increased cell proliferation in the hippocampus, in particular in the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus. (R)-fluoxetine had superior effects to (S)-fluoxetine in elevated plus maze, forced-swim and tail-suspension tests. These results suggest that (R)fluoxetine, which has been reported to have a shorter half-life than (S)-fluoxetine, has superior antidepressant effects and more consistently improves spatial learning and memory. This profile offers advantages in depression treatment and may also aid management of the neurocognitive impairments associated with depression.},

The validity of these mouse models of AD from a behavioral viewpoint, however, has not been extensively evaluated. Thus, using an automated behavior monitoring system, we analyzed various behavioral domains, including executive function, and learning and memory. The App-KI mice carrying NL-G-F mutations showed clear deficits in spatial memory and flexible learning, enhanced compulsive behavior, and reduced attention performance. Mice carrying NL-F mutations exhibited modest abnormalities. The NL-G-F mice had a greater and more rapid accumulation of Ab deposits and glial responses.

Here, we hypothesized that increased expression of endogenous GDNF could induce dopaminergic abnormalities that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. To test the impact of GDNF elevation, without inducing adverse effects caused by ectopic overexpression, we developed a novel in vivo approach to conditionally increase endogenous GDNF expression. We found that a 2\textendash 3-fold increase in endogenous GDNF in the brain was sufficient to induce molecular, cellular, and functional changes in dopamine signalling in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, including increased striatal presynaptic dopamine levels and reduction of dopamine in prefrontal cortex. Mechanistically, we identified adenosine A2a receptor (A               2A               R), a G-protein coupled receptor that modulates dopaminergic signalling, as a possible mediator of GDNF-driven dopaminergic abnormalities.

No differences were observed either in circadian activity or in performance in the novelty-induced exploration test, but middle-aged mice exhibited decreased exploratory activity overall. In the place learning test module, when mice were free to explore all corners without any negative reinforcement, young mice tended not to learn the task and performed less effectively than the middle-aged group. However, when an air-puff was administered as negative reinforcement following visits to an incorrect corner, young mice learned the task significantly better than middle-aged mice throughout the test period. Our data show that, in freely moving mice, the motivational cues for learning and retrieval of memory are age-dependent and dramatically influence learning and memory performance. Furthermore, the data reported here represent a step towards optimised cognitive test protocols when comparing young and middle-aged mice.},

Previous studies had indicated important synaptic functions of APP and the closely related homologue APLP2 in excitatory forebrain neurons for spine density, synaptic plasticity, and behavior. Here, we show that APP is also widely expressed in several interneuron subtypes, both in hippocampus and cortex. To address the functional role of APP in inhibitory neurons, we generated mice with a conditional APP/APLP2 double knockout (cDKO) in GABAergic forebrain neurons using DlxCre mice. These DlxCre cDKO mice exhibit cognitive deficits in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory tasks, as well as impairments in species-typic nesting and burrowing behaviors. Deficits at the behavioral level were associated with altered neuronal morphology and synaptic plasticity Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). Impaired basal synaptic transmission at the Schafer collateral/CA1 pathway, which was associated with altered compound excitatory/inhibitory synaptic currents and reduced action potential firing of CA1 pyramidal cells, points to a disrupted excitation/inhibition balance in DlxCre cDKOs. Together, these impairments may lead to hippocampal dysfunction. Collectively, our data reveal a crucial role of APP family proteins in inhibitory interneurons to maintain functional network activity.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive and psychiatric manifestations. Since the mutation responsible for the disease was identified as an unstable expansion of CAG repeats in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein in 1993, numerous mouse models of HD have been generated to study disease pathogenesis and evaluate potential therapeutic approaches. Of these, knock-in models best mimic the human condition from a genetic perspective since they express the mutation in the appropriate genetic and protein context. Behaviorally, however, while some abnormal phenotypes have been detected in knock-in mouse models, a model with an earlier and more robust phenotype than the existing models is required. We describe here for the first time a new mouse line, the zQ175 knock-in mouse, derived from a spontaneous expansion of the CAG copy number in our CAG 140 knock-in colony [1]. Given the inverse relationship typically observed between age of HD onset and length of CAG repeat, since this new mouse line carries a significantly higher CAG repeat length it was expected to be more significantly impaired than the parent line. Using a battery of behavioral tests we evaluated both heterozygous and homozygous zQ175 mice. Homozygous mice showed motor and grip strength abnormalities with an early onset (8 and 4 weeks of age, respectively), which were followed by deficits in rotarod and climbing activity at 30 weeks of age and by cognitive deficits at around 1 year of age. Of particular interest for translational work, we also found clear behavioral deficits in heterozygous mice from around 4.5 months of age, especially in the dark phase of the diurnal cycle. Decreased body weight was observed in both heterozygotes and homozygotes, along with significantly reduced survival in the homozygotes. In addition, we detected an early and significant decrease of striatal gene markers from 12 weeks of age. These data suggest that the zQ175 knock-in line could be a suitable model for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches and early events in the pathogenesis of HD.},

Furthermore, beneficial effects have been reported from the genetic ablation of TG2 in R6/2 and R6/1 mouse lines. To further evaluate the validity of this target for the treatment of HD, we examined the effects of TG2 deletion in two genetic mouse models of HD: R6/2 CAG 240 and zQ175 knock in (KI). Contrary to previous reports, under rigorous experimental conditions we found that TG2 ablation had no effect on either motor or cognitive deficits, or on the weight loss. In addition, under optimal husbandry conditions, TG2 ablation did not extend R6/2 lifespan. Moreover, TG2 deletion did not change the huntingtin aggregate load in cortex or striatum and did not decrease the brain atrophy observed in either mouse line. Finally, no amelioration of the dysregulation of striatal and cortical gene markers was detected. We conclude that TG2 is not a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of HD.},

Here, using {$\alpha$}CaMKII autophosphorylation-deficient mutant mice (T286A), we show that, in comparison with wild-type animals, they are less resistant to high doses of alcohol and do not show psychostimulant response neither to alcohol injections nor during voluntary alcohol drinking. T286A mutants are also less prone to develop alcohol addiction-related behaviors including an increased motivation for alcohol, persistent alcohol seeking during withdrawal and alcohol consumption on relapse. Finally, we demonstrate that {$\alpha$}CaMKII autophosphorylation regulates also alcohol-induced remodeling of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus and amygdala.

However, the role of these brain immune cells in mediating the effects of stress is still unclear. Fractalkine signaling \textendash{} which comprises the chemokine CX3CL1, mainly expressed by neurons, and its receptor CX3CR1, almost exclusively present on microglia in the healthy brain \textendash{} has been reported to critically regulate microglial activity. Here, we investigated whether interfering with microglial function by deleting the Cx3cr1 gene affects the brain's response to chronic stress. To this purpose, we housed Cx3cr1 knockout and wild-type adult mice in either control or stressful environments for 2 weeks, and investigated the consequences on microglial phenotype and interactions with synapses, synaptic transmission, behavioral response and corticosterone levels. Our results show that hampering neuron\textendash microglia communication via the CX3CR1\textendash CX3CL1 pathway prevents the effects of chronic unpredictable stress on microglial function, short- and long-term neuronal plasticity and depressive-like behavior. Overall, the present findings suggest that microglia-regulated mechanisms may underlie the differential susceptibility to stress and consequently the vulnerability to diseases triggered by the experience of stressful events, such as major depression.},

  abstract = {The {$\alpha$}9{$\alpha$}10-subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has recently garnered interest in biomedicine and is being pursued as an analgesic target. However, the receptor exhibits diverse tissue distribution, the function of which is known to varying degrees, and targeting this receptor for clinical treatments without a broad understanding of its function may have adverse consequences. The {$\alpha$}9{$\alpha$}10-nAChR is expressed in the adrenal and pituitary glands, suggesting a potential role in the stress response, but little is known about its function in this tissue. Here we determined a role for the {$\alpha$}9{$\alpha$}10-nAChR in behavioural and physiological stress responses, by comparing the stress- and affect-related phenotypes of wildtype and {$\alpha$}9-nAChR knockout mice. Na\"ive knockout mice exhibited largely normal behaviour on standard tests of affective behaviour. However, after sub-chronic restraint stress knockout mice showed significantly decreased stress-induced arousal and increased anxiety-like behaviour when compared to wildtype animals. Physiologically, corticosterone responses were muted in knockout mice after an acute stressor, but exaggerated in response to the same stressor after undergoing subchronic stress. Behavioural profiling of the {$\alpha$}9-nAChR knockout mice in the home-cage revealed that circadian patterns of activity were altered when compared to wildtype controls. Furthermore, knockout mice showed altered responses to a period of reward discounting, resulting in anhedonia-like behaviour in a sucrose preference test where WT mice continued to seek reward. These experiments uncover a novel role for the {$\alpha$}9{$\alpha$}10nAChR in mounting a normal stress response and in the regulation of affective- and reward-related behaviour, and suggest that pursuing the receptor for clinical treatments may not be as straightforward as has been suggested.},

IBD are often complicated by mental disorders like anxiety and depression, indicating substantial shifts in the gut-brain axis. However, the mechanisms connecting IBD to mental diseases are still under debate. Here we use             Muc2             mutant mouse model of chronic colitis to uncouple the effects of the intestinal microbiota on host behavior from chronic inflammation in the gut.             Muc2             mutant male mice exhibit high exploratory activity, reduced anxiety-related behaviors, impaired sensorimotor gating, and altered social preference towards males and females. Microbial transfer to wild-type mice via littermate co-housing shows that colitis-associated microbiota rather than inflammation             per se             defines behavioral features in             Muc2             colitis model. Metagenomic profiling and combination of antibiotic treatments revealed that bacterial species             Akkermansia muciniphila             is associated with the behavioral phenotype in mutants, and that its intestinal abundance correlates with social preference towards males. Metabolomic analysis together with pharmacological inhibition of Gly and NMDA receptors helped us to determine that brain glycine is responsible for the behavioral phenotype in             Muc2             mice. Blood and brain metabolic profiles suggest that microbiota-dependent changes in choline metabolism might be involved in regulation of central glycine neurotransmission. Taken together, our data demonstrates that colitis-associated microbiota controls anxiety, sensorimotor gating and social behavior via metabolic regulation of the brain glycinergic system, providing new venues to combat neurological complications of IBD.},

  abstract = {Considerable evidence suggests that brain damage can lead to impairments in locomotive activity in human beings. However, no study has thoroughly investigated the locomotion and morphological changes in animals after IntelliCage Exposure (IE). Therefore, to elucidate the locomotive activity and morphological changes in striatum of mice models of fluid percussion injury (FPI), we designed a novel strategy and utilised an advanced neurobehavioral monitoring device known as the IE system. We observed locomotive functioning, from the induction of injury until complete recovery. To achieve the objectives, mice were divided into four groups, the (i) sham group (n = 8), (ii) FPI group (n = 8), and not subjected to acclimatisation in the IE, (iii) sham group (n = 11) and (iv) FPI group (n = 11), and subjected to acclimatisation in the IE. Locomotive activity was monitored for each group for 5 days. Results suggested that the neuronal damage associated with locomotive impairment could occur in the early hours (3\textendash 6 h) post-FPI. The process of recovery started significantly at 24 h and continued. Results showed a complete restoration in locomotive activity by the FPI mice at 72 h post-trauma. Morphological results suggested that FPI mice with IE showed less dead cells as compared to FPI mice without IE. Our data also suggested a new dimension for the factors influencing FPI recovery. We hypothesise that IE to FPI animals may provide the necessary enriched environment, induce motivated voluntary physical exercises, and enhance social interactions to accelerate striatum-derived neurogenesis. These factors could be beneficial in TBI-related therapeutic strategies.},

Recently, we described three subtypes of somatostatin-expressing (Sst) neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area (VTA) and showed their local inhibitory action on the neighbouring dopaminergic neurons (Nagaeva et al., 2020). Here, we report that VTA Sst neurons also project far outside the VTA and innervate several forebrain regions that are mainly involved in the regulation of emotional behaviour. When we deleted these VTA Sst neurons several behaviours and drug effects were affected, such as home cage activity, sensitization of locomotor activity to morphine, fear conditioning responses, and reactions to inescapable stress of forced swimming, often in a sex-dependent manner. Interestingly, the majority of these Sst projecting neurons was found to express             Vglut2             and             Th             , but not             Dat             . Together, these data demonstrate that VTA Sst neurons have their selective projection targets, which are distinct from the main targets of VTA dopamine neurons and involved in the regulation of a variety of behaviours mostly associated with the stress response. This, in turn, makes these VTA neurons a meaningful addition to the somatostatinergic system of the brain.},

  abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a common mental illness occurring in approximately 1\% of individuals and requires lifelong treatment. Although genetic factors are known to contribute to this disorder, the genetic architecture has not yet been completely clarified. Our initial trio-based exome sequencing study of bipolar disorder showed enrichment of de novo, loss-of-function (LOF) or protein-altering mutations in a combined group with bipolar I and schizoaffective disorders, and the identified de novo mutations were enriched in calcium-related genes. These findings suggested a role for de novo mutations in bipolar disorder. The validity of these statistical associations will be strengthened if the functional impact of the mutations on cellular function and behavior are identified. In this study, we focused on two de novo LOF mutations in calcium-related genes, EHD1 and MACF1, found in patients with bipolar disorder. We first showed that the EHD1 mutation resulted in a truncated protein with diminished effect on neurite outgrowth and inhibited endocytosis. Next, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to establish two knock-in mouse lines to model the in vivo effects of these mutations. We performed behavioral screening using IntelliCage and long-term wheel running analysis. Ehd1 mutant mice showed higher activity in the light phase. Macf1 mutant mice showed diminished attention and persistence to rewards. These behavioral alterations were similar to the phenotypes in previously proposed animal models of bipolar disorder. These findings endorse the possible role of de novo mutations as a component of the genetic architecture of bipolar disorder, which was suggested by the statistical evidence.},

Here, we used an animal model of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in automated IntelliCages and performed local genetic manipulation to investigate how synaptic transmission in the dorsal DG (dDG) affects alcohol-related behaviors. We show that a cue light induces potentiation-like plasticity of dDG synapses in alcohol-naive mice. This process is impaired in mice trained to drink alcohol. Acamprosate (ACA), a drug that reduces alcohol relapse, rescues the impairment of dDG synaptic transmission in alcohol mice. A molecular manipulation that reduces dDG synaptic AMPAR and NMDAR levels increases impulsive alcohol seeking during cue relapse (CR) in alcohol mice but does not affect alcohol reward, motivation or craving. These findings suggest that hindered dDG synaptic transmission specifically underlies impulsive alcohol seeking induced by alcohol cues, a core symptom of AUD.},

For years, researchers in this field have discussed the apparent detrimental effects of the endogenous amino acid homocysteine in the brain. In this study, the roles of hyperhomocysteinemia driven by vitamin B deficiency, as well as potentially beneficial dietary interventions, were investigated in the novel AppNL-G-F knock-in mouse model for AD, simulating an early stage of the disease. Methods: Urine and serum samples were analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method and the impact of different experimental diets on cognitive performance was studied in a comprehensive behavioral test battery. Finally, we analyzed brain samples immunohistochemically in order to assess amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) plaque deposition. Results: Behavioral testing data indicated subtle cognitive deficits in AppNL-G-F compared to C57BL/6J wild type mice. Elevation of homocysteine and homocysteic acid, as well as counteracting dietary interventions, mostly did not result in significant effects on learning and memory performance, nor in a modified A{$\beta$} plaque deposition in 35-week-old AppNL-G-F mice. Conclusion: Despite prominent A{$\beta$} plaque deposition, the AppNL-G-F model merely displays a very mild AD-like phenotype at the investigated age. Older AppNL-G-F mice should be tested in order to further investigate potential effects of hyperhomocysteinemia and dietary interventions.},

At around P14\textendash 16W, NE, GABA and Glu levels in nine brain regions were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, the associations between the neurotransmitter levels and the behavioral indices were statistically analyzed. Results: In females exposed to BPA, the GABA and Glu levels in almost all regions, and the NE levels in the cortex, hypothalamus and thalamus were higher than those in the controls. In males exposed to BPA, the GABA levels in the amygdala and hippocampus showed lower values, while Glu levels were higher in some regions, compared with the controls. In regard to the associations, the number of ``diurnal corner visits without drinking'' was correlated with the NE levels in the cortex and thalamus in females. The ``nocturnal corner visit duration without drinking'' was correlated with the GABA level in the hippocampus in males. Conclusion: These results suggest that prenatal and lactational exposure to low doses of BPA might modulate the NE, GABA and Glu systems, resulting in behavioral alterations. \'O 2014 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

The behavior of offspring was monitored at 11\textendash 13 and 13\textendash 15 weeks of age using an automated behavior assessment system (IntelliCage). Groups of eight mice were tasked with a nose poke, which enabled the mice to open a door to drink bottled water at the corner of their cage. BPA-exposed females visited the corner without drinking behavior during the light cycle less frequently than control female mice did. BPA-exposed males stayed at the corner for longer periods of time and showed a significantly stronger bias in the visit with drinking. In addition, the BPA-exposed males showed a shorter time interval before they visited the corner after preceding animals had visited it, compared with the control males. These findings suggest that prenatal and lactational BPA exposure might affect murine motivational behavior in a social setting differently in males and females.},

This study evaluated Sia effects on rat behavior when administered in a free form as N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) or conjugated as 6 -sialyllactose (6 -SL). Rat milk contains Sia, which peaks at Postnatal Day 9 and drops to a minimum by Day 15. To bypass this Sia peak, a cohort of foster mothers was used to raise the experimental pups. A group of pups received a daily oral supplementation of Neu5Ac to mimic the amount naturally present in rat milk, and another group received the same molar amount of Sia as 6 -SL. The control group received water. After weaning, rats were submitted to behavioral evaluation. One year later, behavior was re-evaluated, and in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) was performed. Brain samples were collected and analyzed at both ages. Adult rats who received Sia performed significantly better in the behavioral assessment and showed an enhanced LTP compared to controls. Within Sia groups, 6 -SL rats showed better scores in some cognitive outcomes compared to Neu5Ac rats. At weaning, an effect on polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) levels in the frontal cortex was only observed in 6 -SL fed rats. Providing Sia during lactation, especially as 6 -SL, improves memory and LTP in adult rats.},

  abstract = {Ohtahara syndrome, also known as type 4 of Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy with suppression bursts (EIEE-4) is currently an untreatable disorder that presents with seizures and impaired cognition. EIEE-4 patients have mutations most frequently in the STXBP1 gene encoding a Sec protein, munc18-1. The exact molecular mechanism of how these munc18-1 mutations cause impaired cognition, remains elusive. The leading haploinsufficiency hypothesis posits that mutations in munc18-1 render the protein unstable leading to its degradation. Expression driven by the healthy allele is not sufficient to maintain the physiological function resulting in haploinsufficiency. The aim of this study has been to understand how munc18-1 haploinsufficiency causes cognitive impairment seen in EIEE-4. Here we present results from behavioral to cellular effects from a mouse model of munc18-1 haploinsufficiency. Munc18-1 heterozygous knock-out mice showed impaired spatial learning and memory in behavior tests as well as reduced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation. Cultured munc18-1 heterozygous hippocampal neurons had significantly slower rate of synaptic vesicle release and decreased readily releasable vesicle pool compared to wild-type control neurons in fluorescent FM dye assays. These results demonstrate that reduced munc18-1 levels are sufficient to impair learning and memory by reducing neurotransmitter release. Therefore, our study implicates munc18-1 haploinsufficiency as a primary cause of cognitive impairment seen in EIEE-4 patients.},

This view has been challenged by the age-dependent seroprevalence (up to {$>$}20\%) of functional NMDAR1-AB of all immunoglobulin classes found in {$>$}5000 individuals, healthy or affected by different diseases. These findings question a merely encephalitogenic role of NMDAR1-AB. Here, we show that NMDAR1AB belong to the normal autoimmune repertoire of dogs, cats, rats, mice, baboons, and rhesus macaques, and are functional in the NMDAR1 internalization assay based on human IPSC-derived cortical neurons. The age dependence of seroprevalence is lost in nonhuman primates in captivity and in human migrants, raising the intriguing possibility that chronic life stress may be related to NMDAR1-AB formation, predominantly of the IgA class. Active immunization of ApoE-/- and ApoE+/+ mice against four peptides of the extracellular NMDAR1 domain or ovalbumin (control) leads to high circulating levels of specific AB. After 4 weeks, the endogenously formed NMDAR1-AB (IgG) induce psychosis-like symptoms upon MK-801 challenge in ApoE-/- mice, characterized by an open blood\textendash brain barrier, but not in their ApoE+/+ littermates, which are indistinguishable from ovalbumin controls. Importantly, NMDAR1-AB do not induce any sign of inflammation in the brain. Immunohistochemical staining for microglial activation markers and T lymphocytes in the hippocampus yields comparable results in ApoE-/- and ApoE+/+ mice, irrespective of immunization against NMDAR1 or ovalbumin. These data suggest that NMDAR1-AB of the IgG class shape behavioral phenotypes upon access to the brain but do not cause brain inflammation on their own.},

  abstract = {Background: Novel experiences activate the brain's reward system in a manner similar to drugs of abuse, and high levels of novelty-seeking and sensation-seeking behavior have been associated with increased susceptibility to alcohol and drug abuse. Here, we show that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling on dopaminoceptive neurons is necessary for both novelty-seeking behavior and the abstinence-induced escalation of alcohol drinking. Methods: Mice harboring a transgene expressing microRNA hairpins against mGluR5 messenger RNA under the control of the D1 dopamine receptor gene promoter (mGluR5KD-D1) were tested in a battery of behavioral tests measuring learning abilities, anxiety levels, reactions to novelty, operant sensation seeking, and alcohol sensitivity. In addition, we have developed a method to assess long-term patterns of alcohol drinking in mice housed in groups using the IntelliCage system. Results: mGluR5KD-D1 mice showed no behavioral deficits and exhibited normal anxiety-like behaviors and learning abilities. However, mGluR5KD-D1 animals showed reduced locomotor activity when placed in a novel environment, and exhibited decreased interaction with a novel object. Moreover, unlike control animals, mutant mice did not perform instrumental responses under the operant sensation-seeking paradigm, although they learned to respond for food normally. When mGluR5KD-D1 mice were provided access to alcohol, they showed similar patterns of consumption as wild-type animals. However, mutant mice did not escalate their alcohol consumption after a period of forced abstinence, but control mice almost doubled their intake. Conclusions: These data identify mGluR5 receptors on D1-expressing neurons as a common molecular substrate of novelty-seeking behaviors and behaviors associated with alcohol abuse.},

It is highly expressed in the salivary and mammary glands and secreted into saliva and milk. Although CA VI was first described as a gustatory protein, its exact functional roles have remained enigmatic. Interestingly, polymorphism of the CA6 gene was recently linked to bitter taste perception in humans. In this study, we compared the preference of Car6-/- and wild-type mice for different taste modalities in an IntelliCage monitoring environment. Morphologies of taste buds, tongue papillae, and von Ebner's glands were evaluated by light microscopy. Cell proliferation and rate of apoptosis in tongue specimens were examined by Ki67 immunostaining and fluorescent DNA fragmentation staining, respectively. Results: The behavioral follow up of the mice in an IntelliCage system revealed that Car6-/- mice preferred 3 {$\mu$}M quinine (bitter) solution, whereas wild type mice preferred water. When the quinine concentration increased, both groups preferentially selected water. Histological analysis, Ki67 immunostaining and detection of apoptosis did not reveal any significant changes between tongue specimens of the knockout and wild type mice. Conclusions: Our knockout mouse model confirms that CA VI is involved in bitter taste perception. CA VI may be one of the factors which contribute to avoidance of bitter, potentially harmful, substances.},

Valproic acid (VPA) was reported to increase the prevalence of ASD in humans as a consequence of its use during pregnancy. VPA treatment also induces autistic-like behaviors in the offspring of rats after prenatal exposure; hence it is a preclinical disease model with high translational value. In the present study, our aim was to characterize ASD relevant behaviors of socially housed, individually identified male rats in automated home cages. The natural behavior of rats was assessed by monitoring their visits to drinking bottles in an environment without human influence aiming at reducing interventional stress. Although rodents normally tend to explore their new environment, prenatally VPA-treated rats showed a drastic impairment in initial and long-term exploratory behavior throughout their stay in the automated cage. Furthermore, VPA rats displayed psychogenic polydipsia (PPD) as well as altered circadian activity. In the competitive situation of strict water deprivation controls switched to an uneven resource sharing and only a few dominant animals had access to water. In VPA animals similar hierarchy-related changes were completely absent. While the control rats secured their chance to drink with frequent reentering visits, thereby ``guarding'' the water resource, VPA animals did not switch to uneven sharing and displayed no evidence of guarding behavior.},

We studied the impact of scopolamine treatment in a relevant dose-range on activity, drinking behavior and reversal learning of C57BL/DJ mice in a homecage-like, social environment, using the IntelliCage. Na\"ive mice were first habituated to the IntelliCage, where they learned to nosepoke in any of the four corners in order to gain access to the water reward. Visits, nosepokes, lick numbers and durations were recorded. Mice were then trained to distinguish between a rewarded correct corner and punished, incorrect corners. Later, in the reversal learning phase, the assigned correct corner was rotated clockwise every 24 h. Upon s.c. administration of scopolamine general activity represented by visit and nosepoke numbers increased, but their durations were shorter. Surprisingly, general activity and lick behavior were drastically altered. Scopolamine also significantly reduced the ability to perform a reversal learning task. We not only found significant decline in reversal learning due to scopolamine treatment, but studied the method specific underlying behaviors: the general activity and lick behavior as well.},

Models of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias aim to reproduce the brain pathology associated with these neurodegenerative disorders. Transgenic models, which involve random insertion of disease-causing genes under the control of artificial promoters, are efficient means of doing so. There are confounding factors associated with transgenic approaches, however, including target gene overexpression, dysregulation of endogenous gene expression at transgenes' integration sites, and limitations in mimicking loss-of-function mechanisms. Furthermore, the choice of species is important, and there are anatomical, physiological, and cognitive reasons for favoring the rat over the mouse, which has been the standard for models of neurodegeneration and dementia. We report an initial assessment of the spatial learning, reversal, and sequencing task capabilities of knock-in Long-Evans rats with humanizing mutations in the A{$\beta$}-coding region of             App             , which encodes amyloid precursor protein (             App             h/h             rats), using the IntelliCage, an automated operant social home cage system, at 6-8 weeks of age, then again at 4-5 months of age.

  abstract = {The molecular alterations that underlie the long-lasting behavioural effects of drugs of abuse, such as psychomotor sensitization and physical dependence, are still not known. Moreover, it is not known which molecular effects are similar for addictive drugs from various pharmacological classes. In this study, we utilized wholegenome microarray profiling to evaluate the detailed time-course of transcriptional alterations in the mouse striatum during chronic treatment with heroin (HER) and methamphetamine (METH) and after period of spontaneous withdrawal. We identified 27 genes regulated by chronic drug administration. The overlap between lists of HER- and METH-induced genes was highly significant. The most substantial impact on the gene expression profile was observed for circadian genes (Per1, Per2 and Nr1d1). However, changing the treatment scheme from diurnal to nocturnal was sufficient to attenuate the drug-induced changes in circadian gene mRNA levels. Both of the drugs caused a dose-dependent induction in glucocorticoid-dependent genes with relatively long mRNA half-lives (Fkbp5, Sult1a1 and Plin4). The analysis also showed a drug-regulated group of transcripts enriched in the nucleus accumbens and includes well known (Pdyn, Cartpt and Rgs2) as well as new (Fam40b and Inmt) candidate genes. All identified alterations in the striatal transcriptome were transient and persisted up to 6 days after withdrawal. Behavioural sensitization, however, was maintained throughout the 12-day withdrawal period for both HER and METH. We suggest that transient gene expression alterations during drug treatment and in the early period of withdrawal are involved in the establishment of persistent neuroplastic alterations responsible for the development of drug addiction.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of studies show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) exert their therapeutic action, at least in part, by amplifying the influence of the living environment on mood. As a consequence, when administered in a favorable environment, SSRIs lead to a reduction of symptoms, but in stressful conditions, they show limited efficacy. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches able to neutralize the influence of the stressful environment on treatment are needed. The aim of our study was to test whether, in a mouse model of depression, the combined administration of SSRI fluoxetine and metformin, a drug able to improve the metabolic profile, counteracts the limited efficacy of fluoxetine alone when administered in stressful conditions. Indeed, metabolic alterations are associated to both the onset of major depression and the antidepressant efficacy. To this goal, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to stress for 6 weeks; the first two weeks was aimed at generating a mouse model of depression. During the remaining 4 weeks, mice received one of the following treatments: vehicle, fluoxetine, metformin, or a combination of fluoxetine and metformin. We measured liking- and wanting-type anhedonia as behavioral phenotypes of depression and assessed the expression levels of selected genes involved in major depressive disorder and antidepressant response in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, which are differently involved in the depressive symptomatology. The combined treatment was more effective than fluoxetine alone in ameliorating the depressive phenotype after one week of treatment. This was associated to an increase in IGF2 mRNA expression and enhanced long-term potentiation, specifically in the dorsal hippocampus, at the end of treatment. Overall, the present results show that, when administered in stressful conditions, the combined fluoxetine and metformin treatment may represent a more effective approach than fluoxetine alone in a short term. Finally, our findings highlight the relevance of polypharmacological strategy as effective interventions to increase the efficacy of the antidepressant drugs currently available.},

  abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for major depressive disorder. It has been recently proposed that these drugs, by enhancing neural plasticity, amplify the influences of the living conditions on mood. Consequently, SSRI outcome depends on the quality of the environment, improving symptomatology mainly in individuals living in favorable conditions. In adverse conditions, drugs with a different mechanism of action might have higher efficacy. The antibiotic minocycline, with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, has been recently proposed as a novel potential antidepressant treatment. To explore the drug-by-environment interaction, we compared the effects on depressive-like behavior and neural plasticity of the SSRI fluoxetine and minocycline in enriched and stressful conditions. We first exposed C57BL/6 adult female mice to 14 days of chronic unpredictable mild stress to induce a depressive-like profile. Afterward, mice received vehicle, fluoxetine, or minocycline for 21 days, while exposed to either enriched or stressful conditions. During the first five days, fluoxetine led to an improvement in enrichment but not in stress. By contrast, minocycline led to an improvement in both conditions. After 21 days, all groups showed a significant improvement in enrichment while fluoxetine worsened the depressive like behavior in stress. The effects of the drugs on neural plasticity, measured as long-term potentiation, were also environment-dependent. Overall, we show that the environment affects fluoxetine but not minocycline outcome, indicating that the latter represents a potential alternative to SSRIs to treat depressed patients living in adverse conditions. From a translation perspective, our finding call for considering the drug-by-environment interaction to select the most effective pharmacological treatment.},

Although such an approach offers good control over behavior, it does not allow for researching either voluntary responses or individual differences. Importantly for neuroscience studies, the activity of the neural circuits involved in producing unnatural, artificial behavior is variable and hard to predict. In addition, different ensembles may be activated depending on the strategy the animal adopts to deal with the spurious problem. Thus, artificial and simplified tasks based on responses, which do not occur spontaneously entail problems with modeling behavioral impairments and underlying brain deficits. To develop valid models of human disorders we need to test spontaneous behaviors consistently engaging well-defined, evolutionarily conserved neuronal circuits. Such research focuses on behavioral patterns relevant for surviving and thriving under varying environmental conditions, which also enable high reproducibility across different testing settings.},

  abstract = {Repetitive behaviors are a key feature of many pervasive developmental disorders, such as autism. As a heterogeneous group of symptoms, repetitive behaviors are conceptualized into two main subgroups: sensory/motor (lower-order) and cognitive rigidity (higher-order). Although lower-order repetitive behaviors are measured in mouse models in several paradigms, so far there have been no high-throughput tests directly measuring cognitive rigidity. We describe a novel approach for monitoring repetitive behaviors during reversal learning in mice in the automated IntelliCage system. During the reward-motivated place preference reversal learning, designed to assess cognitive abilities of mice, visits to the previously rewarded places were recorded to measure cognitive flexibility. Thereafter, emotional flexibility was assessed by measuring conditioned fear extinction. Additionally, to look for neuronal correlates of cognitive impairments, we measured CA3-CA1 hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP). To standardize the designed tests we used C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, representing two genetic backgrounds, for induction of autism by prenatal exposure to the sodium valproate. We found impairments of place learning related to perseveration and no LTP impairments in C57BL/6 valproate-treated mice. In contrast, BALB/c valproate-treated mice displayed severe deficits of place learning not associated with perseverative behaviors and accompanied by hippocampal LTP impairments. Alterations of cognitive flexibility observed in C57BL/6 valproate-treated mice were related to neither restricted exploration pattern nor to emotional flexibility. Altogether, we showed that the designed tests of cognitive performance and perseverative behaviors are efficient and highly replicable. Moreover, the results suggest that genetic background is crucial for the behavioral effects of prenatal valproate treatment.},

  abstract = {Objective: To establish chronic sleep deprivation mouse model, evaluate the learning and memory ability of mice and observe autophagy and apoptosis levels in mouse brain. Methods: C57BL/6 mice (n=20) were randomly separated into sleep deprivation group and control group. After 2-month sleep deprivation by using an adapted multiple platform method, the behavioral performance of mice was measured by IntelliCage system. The expression of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Beclin-1 was detected by Western blotting. Confocol microscopy was used to observe autophagosome. In addition, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to detect neuronal apoptosis level in mouse brain. Results: The results of behavioral test showed that the incorrect visit ratio was much higher in sleep deprivation group than that in control group. Moreover, the expression of LC3-II(sleep deprivation group 1.681{$\pm$}0.186, control group 1.125{$\pm$}0.048, t=2.892, P=0.027 6) and Beclin-1(sleep deprivation group 1.144{$\pm$}0.048, control group 1.006{$\pm$}0.017, t=2.721, P=0.018 6) in mouse hippocampus and cortex was significantly elevated in sleep deprivation group than those in control group. Accordingly, the confocal microscopy observation also revealed an increased nuclear LC3-positive puncta in hippocampus and cortex of sleep deprived mice (hippocampus in sleep deprivation group 1.665{$\pm$}0.153, in control group 0.819{$\pm$}0.072, t=5.024, P=0.002 4; cortex in sleep deprivation group 1.925{$\pm$}0.175, in control group 1.195{$\pm$}0.111, t=3.521, P=0.012 5). In addition, TUNEL staining showed a much higher percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei in these brain regions (hippocampus in sleep deprivation group 47.24{$\pm$}4.15, in control group 19.26{$\pm$}3.72, t=5.025, P=0.007 4; cortex in sleep deprivation group 42.25{$\pm$}1.25, in control group 27.50{$\pm$}3.23, t=4.262, P=0.005 3). Conclusions: Chronic sleep deprivation can impair the learning and memory, increase the expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1, elevate the formation of autophagosome, and promote apoptosis in mouse brain. These findings suggest that autophagy and apoptosis might be involved in the cognitive impairment induced by chronic sleep deprivation.},

On the level of cellular signaling, regulator of G protein signaling 2 (Rgs2) has been implicated in human and rodent anxiety. However, there is limited knowledge about the role of Rgs2 in fear learning and reactivity to stress. In this study, Rgs2-/- mice showed increased fear learning, male mice displayed increased contextual and cued fear learning, while females showed selectively enhanced cued fear learning. Male Rgs2-/- mice displayed increased long-term-contextual fear memory, but increased cued fear extinction. Learning in spatial non-aversive paradigms was also increased in Rgs2-/- mice. Female, but not male mice show increased spatial learning in the Barnes maze, while male mice showed enhanced place preference in the IntelliCage, rendering enhanced cognitive function non-specific for aversive stimuli. Consistent with the previous results, Rgs2 deletion resulted in increased innate anxiety, including neophobic behavior expressed as hypolocomotion, in three different tests based on the approach-avoidance conflict. Acute electric foot shock stress provoked hypolocomotion in several exploration-based tests, suggesting fear generalization in both genotypes. Rgs2 deletion was associated with reduced monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and disturbed corresponding GPCR expression of the adrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and neuropeptide Y system. Taken together, Rgs2 deletion promotes improved cognitive function as well as increased anxiety-like behavior, but has no effect on acute stress reactivity. These effects may be related to the observed disruption of the monoaminergic systems.},

Unclear, however, is whether the same phenotypes can be observed in laboratory animals prone to uncontrolled alcohol drinking. To characterize a novelty-seeking trait, anxiety, impulsivity, compulsivity and the motivation for natural rewards in mice, numerous tests were performed in the automated IntelliCage learning system. The same mice then had extended access to alcohol for 70 days, followed by the evaluation of addiction-like behaviors, including (1) the motivation for alcohol in a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement; (2) persistent and compulsive alcohol seeking and taking during signaled `no alcohol' periods and (3) when subjected to punishment; and (4) the intensity of relapse after alcohol withdrawal. Our data suggest that high levels of anxiety-related traits (i.e. low novelty seeking, low resistance to punishment and a high level of compulsive behaviors) and high impulsivity predict addiction-like alcohol drinking in mice. Future studies are, however, warranted to create a valid model of alcohol addiction in mice in the IntelliCage system.},

  abstract = {Hearing impairment is the most common sensory disorder in humans. So far, rehabilitation of profoundly deaf subjects relies on direct stimulation of the auditory nerve through cochlear implants. However, in some forms of genetic hearing impairment, the organ of Corti is structurally intact and therapeutic replacement of the mutated gene could potentially restore near natural hearing. In the case of defects of the otoferlin gene (OTOF), such gene therapy is hindered by the size of the coding sequence ({$\sim$}6 kb) exceeding the cargo capacity ({$<$}5 kb) of the preferred viral vector, adeno-associated virus (AAV). Recently, a dual-AAV approach was used to partially restore hearing in deaf otoferlin knock-out (Otof-KO) mice. Here, we employed in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the gene-therapeutic potential of naturally-occurring and newly-developed synthetic AAVs overloaded with the full-length Otof coding sequence. Upon early postnatal injection into the cochlea of Otof-KO mice, overloaded AAVs drove specific expression of otoferlin in {$\sim$}30\% of all IHCs, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence labeling and polymerase chain reaction. Recordings of auditory brainstem responses and a behavioral assay demonstrated partial restoration of hearing. Together, our results suggest that viral gene therapy of DFNB9\textemdash using a single overloaded AAV vector\textemdash is indeed feasible, reducing the complexity of gene transfer compared to dual-AAV approaches.},

Next, effects of cholinergic (scopolamine) and glutamatergic (Phenylcyclidine, PCP) receptor antagonism and dopaminergic agonism (apomorphine) on activity were assessed in the PhenoTyper and IntelliCage. Finally, the IntelliCage was utilised to determine differences in activity and spatial learning of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse strains following pharmacological intervention. Results: AM251 induced a suppression of food intake, feeding behaviour and a reduction in body weight in both the PhenoTyper and PhenoMaster. Apomorphine reduced activity in both the PhenoTyper and IntelliCage. Whereas, decreased activity was evident with PCP in the PhenoTyper, but not IntelliCage and Scopolamine induced a trend towards elevated levels of activity in the IntelliCage but not PhenoTyper. Strain differences in activity and spatial learning were also evident, with increased corner visits and drug induced impairments only observed with C57BL/6 mice. Comparison with existing method: The automated home cage observation systems determined similar drug and strain effects on behaviour to those observed using traditional methods. Conclusions: All three observation systems reported drug-induced changes in behaviour however, they differ in their application of spatial learning tasks and utilisation of single versus group housed recordings.},

  abstract = {The calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) is a recognized marker of short-axon GABA-ergic neurons in the cortex and the hippocampus. However in addition, PV is expressed by excitatory, glutamatergic neurons in various areas of the brain and spinal cord. Depending on the location of these neurons, loading of their synaptic vesicles with glutamate is mediated by either of three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGlut): VGlut1, VGlut2, or VGlut3. Driven by our interest in one of these glutamatergic/PV-expressing cell clusters\textemdash the lateral hypothalamic parvafox nucleus\textemdash we investigated the functions of this population of neurons by the selective deletion of VGlut2 expression in PV-expressing cells according to the Cre/Lox-approach. PV-Cre;VGlut2-Lox mutant mice are phenotypically characterized by deficits in locomotion and vocalization, by a decreased thermal nociception, and by an increased social dominance. We conducted a search of the Allen Brain Atlas for regions that might co-express the genes encoding PV and VGlut2, and that might thus contribute to the manifestation of the observed phenotypes. Our survey revealed several structures that could contribute to the deficits in locomotion and vocalization, such as the red, the subthalamic and the deep cerebellar nuclei. It also disclosed that a shift in the balance of afferental glutamatergic neurotransmission to the periaqueductal gray matter might be accountable for the decrease in sensitivity to pain and for the increase in social dominance. As a whole, this study broadens the state of knowledge about PV-expressing excitatory neurons.},

  abstract = {Cranial radiotherapy in the treatment of pediatric malignancies may lead to cognitive deficits, and girls suffer more severe deficits than boys. However, most experimental studies are performed on male animals only. Our aim was to investigate possible long-term gender differences in response to cranial irradiation (IR). Basal neurogenesis in non-irradiated mice was higher in females but this was not apparent until the animals were adult. Male and female C57BL {$\fracslash$} 6J mice received a single dose of 8 Gy to the whole brain on postnatal day 14 and were killed 6 h or 4 months later. Proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, as judged by the number of phosphohistone H3-positive cells, was reduced by half 6 h after IR in both males and females. The reduced proliferation was still obvious 4 months after IR. Consequently, the continuous addition of new neurons to the granule cell layer (GCL) during brain growth was reduced in irradiated mice, and the reduction was more pronounced in females. This resulted in hampered growth of the GCL, reduced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in adulthood, and severely reduced adult neurogenesis, as judged by the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the GCL. In an open-field test, locomotor activity was increased in both males and females after IR and anxiety levels were increased, more so in females. In an IntelliCage test, place learning was impaired by IR in females but not males.},

To facilitate the search for new potential treatments of HD, an automated system for analyzing the behavior of transgenic HD mice is urgently needed. A recently developed behavior screening system, the IntelliCage, allows automated testing of mouse behavior in the home cage employing individual recognition of animals living in social groups. The present study validates the ability of the IntelliCage system to detect behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in R6/2 mice, an established transgenic model of HD. The results indicate that the IntelliCage is a reliable system for recording exploratory activity, drinking behavior, circadian rhythm, spatial preference, and cognition in mice during prolonged periods of assessment. The system detected early dysfunctional behaviors in R6/2 mice, such as decrease in exploratory activity, sleep disturbances, increased drinking, and repetitive behavior. Additionally, the use of various learning tasks, such as spatial avoidance and spatial patrolling, revealed early cognitive changes in R6/2 mice. The simple learning tasks may be used at both early and late stages of the disease.},

  abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a heritable neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by metabolic disturbances, along with cognitive and psychiatric impairments. Targeting metabolic HD dysfunction via the maintenance of body weight and fat mass and restoration of peripheral energy metabolism can improve the progression of neurological symptoms. In this respect, we focused on the therapeutic potential of the orexigenic peptide hormone ghrelin, which plays an important role in promoting a positive energy balance. In the present study, we found a significant disruption of circadian metabolic regulation in a R6/2 mouse HD model in the late stage of disease. Daily circadian rhythms of activity, energy expenditure, respiratory exchange ratio and feeding were strongly attenuated in R6/2 mice. During the rest phase, R6/2 mice had a higher total activity, elevated energy expenditure and excessive water consumption compared to control mice. We also found that, in the late stage of disease, R6/2 mice had ghrelin axis deficiency as a result of low circulating ghrelin levels, in addition to down-regulation of the ghrelin receptor and several key signalling molecules in the hypothalamus, as well as a reduced responsiveness to exogenous peripheral ghrelin. We demonstrated that, in pre-symptomatic mice, responsiveness to ghrelin is preserved. Chronic ghrelin treatment efficiently increased lean body mass and decreased the energy expenditure and fat utilisation of R6/2 mice in the early stage of disease. In addition, ghrelin treatment was also effective in the normalisation of drinking behaviour and the rest activity of these mice. Ghrelin treatment could provide a novel therapeutic possibility for delaying disease progression; however, deficiency in ghrelin receptor expression could limit its therapeutic potential in the late stage of disease.},

Lack of FTO in D2 MSNs translates into increased locomotor activity to novelty, associated with altered timing behavior, without impairing the ability to control actions or affecting rewarddriven and conditioned behavior. Pharmacological manipulations of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)- or D2R-dependent pathways in these animals reveal altered responses to D1- and D2-MSN-mediated control of motor output. These findings reveal a critical role for FTO to control D2 MSN excitability, their projections to the GPe, and behavioral responses to novelty.},

  abstract = {Anxiety disorders are the most common forms of mental illness of the adult population of the U.S.A. Use of animal models for anxiety has made an important contribution to clinical and pharmacological anxiety research as well as basic research of the mechanisms involved. We review the current operant conditioning models that are used in anxiety research as well as paradigms using unconditioned fear responses. We then outline how they could theoretically and in practice be adapted to the settings of a novel automated system, the IntelliCage. The IntelliCage is a computer-controlled environment for socially housed mice that automatically records a number of behavioral parameters for each mouse and in addition allows to individually condition and test mice. IntelliCage allows fast and efficient test procedures for evaluating fear responses with a minimum of handling stress and a maximum of standardization. To confirm suitability of the IntelliCage for the study of anxiety, we present results on a modified Vogel water-lick conflict for mice. After 18 hours of water deprivation, mice were exposed to the following three conditions: punished drinking, punished drinking after injection of Diazepam, and punished drinking after injection of saline. The IntelliCage automatically quantified and recorded behavioral parameters indicative of anxiety for each individual. None of the parameters differed between untreated and saline treated control mice. In contrast, animals treated with Diazepam significantly differed from the two other groups in several aspects indicative of decreased anxiety elicited by the aversive stimulus. The results were robust and remained unchanged after correction for individual differences and drug-induced differences in activity. Our study shows that the IntelliCage can be used to assess anxiety and anxiolytic drug effects in a fast and efficient way.},

However, they have been found to activate vertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and could be toxic to the mammalian brain. In the present study, we evaluated the developmental neurotoxicity of acetamiprid (ACE), one of the most widely used neonicotinoids, in C57BL/6J mice whose mothers were administered ACE via gavage at doses of either 0 mg/kg (control group), 1.0 mg/kg (low-dose group), or 10.0 mg/kg (high-dose group) from gestational day 6 to lactation day 21. The results of a battery of behavior tests for socio-sexual and anxiety-related behaviors, the numbers of vasopressin-immunoreactive cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and testosterone levels were used as endpoints. In addition, behavioral flexibility in mice was assessed in a group-housed environment using the IntelliCage, a fully automated mouse behavioral analysis system. In adult male mice exposed to ACE at both low and high doses, a significant reduction of anxiety level was found in the light-dark transition test. Males in the low-dose group also showed a significant increase in sexual and aggressive behaviors. In contrast, neither the anxiety levels nor the sexual behaviors of females were altered. No reductions in the testosterone level, the number of vasopressin-immunoreactive cells, or behavioral flexibility were detected in either sex. These results suggest the possibility that in utero and lactational ACE exposure interferes with the development of the neural circuits required for executing socio-sexual and anxiety-related behaviors in male mice specifically.},

Astrocytes engage in glia-synaptic interactions through peripheral astrocyte processes, thus modulating synaptic signaling, for example, by handling glutamate removal from the synaptic cleft and (re)provision to axonal terminals. Peripheral astrocyte processes are ultrafine membrane protrusions rich in the membrane-to-actin cytoskeleton linker Ezrin, an essential component of in vitro filopodia formation and in vivo peripheral astrocyte process motility. Consequently, it has been postulated that Ezrin significantly contributes to neurodevelopment as well as astrocyte functions within the adult brain. However, while Ezrin has been studied in vitro within cultured primary astrocytes, in vivo studies on the role of Ezrin in astrocytes remain to be conducted and consequences of its depletion to be studied. Here, we investigated consequences of Ezrin deletion in the mouse brain starting from early neuronal specification. While Ezrin knockout did not impact prenatal cerebral cortex development, behavioral phenotyping depicted reduced exploratory behavior. Starting with postnatal appearance of glia cells, Ezrin was verified to remain predominantly expressed in astrocytes. Proteome analysis of Ezrin deficient astrocytes revealed alterations in glutamate and ion homeostasis, metabolism and cell morphology \textendash{} important processes for synaptic signal transmission. Notably, Ezrin deletion in astrocytes provoked (GFAP) glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation \textendash{} a marker of astrocyte activation and reactive astrogliosis.

  abstract = {Decreased cognitive performance is a hallmark of brain aging, but the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic avenues remain poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed health-protective and lifespanextending effects of dietary spermidine, a natural autophagy-promoting polyamine. Here, we show that dietary spermidine passes the blood-brain barrier in mice and increases hippocampal eIF5A hypusination and mitochondrial function. Spermidine feeding in aged mice affects behavior in homecage environment tasks, improves spatial learning, and increases hippocampal respiratory competence. In a Drosophila aging model, spermidine boosts mitochondrial respiratory capacity, an effect that requires the autophagy regulator Atg7 and the mitophagy mediators Parkin and Pink1. Neuron-specific Pink1 knockdown abolishes spermidine-induced improvement of olfactory associative learning. This suggests that the maintenance of mitochondrial and autophagic function is essential for enhanced cognition by spermidine feeding. Finally, we show large-scale prospective data linking higher dietary spermidine intake with a reduced risk for cognitive impairment in humans.},

Progranulin-deficient mice (Grn-/-) are moderately overweight during middle age. We therefore asked if there was a connection between progranulin/CD36 in the tongue and fat taste preferences. By using unbiased behavioral analyses in IntelliCages and Phenomaster cages we showed that progranulin-deficient mice (Grn-/-) developed a strong preference of fat taste in the form of 2\% milk over 0.3\% milk, and for diluted MCTs versus tap water. The fat preference in the 7d-IntelliCage observation period caused an increase of 10\% in the body weight of Grn-/- mice, which did not occur in the wildtype controls. CD36 expression in taste buds was reduced in Grn-/- mice at RNA and histology levels. There were no differences in the plasma or tongue lipids of various classes including sphingolipids, ceramides and endocannabinoids. The data suggest that progranulin deficiency leads to a lower expression of CD36 in the tongue resulting in a stronger urge for fatty taste and fatty nutrition.},

  abstract = {Resilience to stress is critical for the development of depression. Enhanced adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) signaling mediates the antidepressant effects of acute sleep deprivation (SD). However, chronic SD causes long-lasting upregulation of brain A1R and increases the risk of depression. To investigate the effects of A1R on mood, we utilized two transgenic mouse lines with inducible A1R overexpression in forebrain neurons. These two lines have identical levels of A1R increase in the cortex, but differ in the transgenic A1R expression in the hippocampus. Switching on the transgene promotes robust antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in both lines. The mice of the line without transgenic A1R overexpression in the hippocampus (A1Hipp-) show very strong resistance towards development of stress-induced chronic depression-like behavior. In contrast, the mice of the line in which A1R upregulation extends to the hippocampus (A1Hipp+), exhibit decreased resilience to depression as compared to A1Hipp-. Similarly, automatic analysis of reward behavior of the two lines reveals that depression resistant A1Hipp-transgenic mice exhibit high sucrose preference, while mice of the vulnerable A1Hipp + line developed stress-induced anhedonic phenotype. The A1Hipp + mice have increased Homer1a expression in hippocampus, correlating with impaired long-term potentiation in the CA1 region, mimicking the stressed mice. Furthermore, virus-mediated overexpression of Homer1a in the hippocampus decreases stress resilience. Taken together our data indicate for first time that increased expression of A1R and Homer1a in the hippocampus modulates the resilience to stress-induced depression and thus might potentially mediate the detrimental effects of chronic sleep restriction on mood.},

In the last decade, the habenula has gained increased attention due to its major role to modulate emotional behavior and related psychopathologies, including depression and bipolar disorder, through the modulation of monoamines' neurotransmission. However, it is still unclear which genetic factors may directly affect the function of the habenula and hence, could contribute to the psychopathological mechanisms of mood disorders.

The current study aimed to probe morphological features of the habenula in the DISC1-Q31L mouse line and detect novel behavioral endophenotypes, including the increased emotionality in mutant females, high aggression in mutant males and deficient extinction of fear memory in DISC1 mutant mice of both sexes. The histological analysis found the increased neural density in the lateral and medial habenula in DISC1-Q31L mice regardless of sex, hence, excluding direct association between the habenular neurons and emotionality in mutant females.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mental disorders are a significant cause of disability worldwide. They profoundly affect individuals' well-being and impose a substantial financial burden on societies and governments. However, despite decades of extensive research, the effectiveness of current therapeutics for mental disorders is often not satisfactory or well tolerated by the patient. Moreover, most novel therapeutic candidates fail in clinical testing during the most expensive phases (II and III), which results in the withdrawal of pharma companies from investing in the field. It also brings into question the effectiveness of using animal models in preclinical studies to discover new therapeutic agents and predict their potential for treating mental illnesses in humans. Here, we focus on rodents as animal models and propose that they are essential for preclinical investigations of candidate therapeutic agents' mechanisms of action and for testing their safety and efficiency. Nevertheless, we argue that there is a need for a paradigm shift in the methodologies used to measure animal behavior in laboratory settings. Specifically, behavioral readouts obtained from short, highly controlled tests in impoverished environments and social contexts as proxies for complex human behavioral disorders might be of limited face validity. Conversely, animal models that are monitored in more naturalistic environments over long periods display complex and ethologically relevant behaviors that reflect evolutionarily conserved endophenotypes of translational value. We present how semi-natural setups in which groups of mice are individually tagged, and video recorded continuously can be attainable and affordable. Moreover, novel open-source machine-learning techniques for pose estimation enable continuous and automatic tracking of individual body parts in groups of rodents over long periods. The trajectories of each individual animal can further be subjected to supervised machine learning algorithms for automatic detection of specific behaviors (e.g., chasing, biting, or fleeing) or unsupervised automatic detection of behavioral motifs (e.g., stereotypical movements that might be harder to name or label manually). Compared to studies of animals in the wild, semi-natural environments are more compatible with neural and genetic manipulation techniques. As such, they can be used to study the neurobiological mechanisms underlying naturalistic behavior. Hence, we suggest that such a paradigm possesses the best out of classical ethology and the reductive behaviorist approach and may provide a breakthrough in discovering new efficient therapies for mental illnesses.},

General activity and water consumption were examined using the IntelliCage (IC) in adulthood.

Social isolation during PND16\textendash 22 led to the greatest behavioral changes in all sessions of the experiment. These rats were more active, consumed more water, demonstrated a higher ratio of visits with drinking to the total number, and relearned faster after changing the location of the rewarded corner. Thus, the postnatal period between days 16 and 22 in WAG/Rij rat pups is more sensitive to social isolation for change of adaptive behavior in the IC in adulthood.},

Clinical observations have reported that chronic sleep deprivation (SD) may serve as a risk factor for AD. However, the pathological evidence for this assumption is still lacking. In the present study, we examined the potential impacts of chronic SD on learning-memory and AD-related pathologies in A{$\beta$}PP(swe)/PS1({$\Delta$}E9) transgenic (TG) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. Results indicated that mice (both TG and WT) exposed to 2-month SD showed an altered amyloid-{$\beta$} protein precursor processing, an elevated level of phosphorylated tau protein, and impaired cognitive performance as compared to non-sleep deprivation (NSD) controls. Moreover, the SD-treated TG mice exhibited more amyloid-{$\beta$}(1-42) production and developed more senile plaques in the cortex and hippocampus than NSD-treated TG mice. In addition, SD caused a striking neuronal mitochondrial damage, caspase cascade activation, and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus of both TG and WT mice. More importantly, all these behavioral, neuropathological, and biochemical changes induced by chronic SD were long lasting and were irreversible during a 3-month normal housing condition. Collectively, these results indicate that chronic SD impairs learning and memory, exacerbates AD pathologies, and aggravates the mitochondria-mediated neuronal apoptosis in a long-lasting manner. Our findings provide important experimental evidence to prove that chronic SD is a risk factor for AD.}

Results A significant main effect of rmTBI was observed on acute measures of spontaneous home-cage activity, with PE mice recovering to baseline levels more quickly. Under both enrichment conditions, rmTBI significantly increased time spent in the light chamber and open arms, decreased contextual fear memory, but did not alter spatial learning.

MuHtt increases p75NTR-associated deleterious signalling and decreases survival signalling suggesting that p75NTR could be a valuable therapeutic target. This hypothesis was investigated by examining the effects of an orally bioavailable, small molecule p75NTR ligand, LM11A-31, on HD-related neuropathology in HD mouse models (R6/2, BACHD). LM11A-31 restored striatal AKT and other pro-survival signalling while inhibiting c-Jun kinase (JNK) and other degenerative signalling. Normalizing p75NTR signalling with LM11A-31 was accompanied by reduced Htt aggregates and striatal cholinergic interneuron degeneration as well as extended survival in R6/2 mice. The p75NTR ligand also decreased inflammation, increased striatal and hippocampal dendritic spine density, and improved motor performance and cognition in R6/2 and BACHD mice. These results support small molecule modulation of p75NTR as an effective HD therapeutic strategy. LM11A-31 has successfully completed Phase I safety and pharmacokinetic clinical trials and is therefore a viable candidate for clinical studies in HD.},

Animal models commonly used to test these symptoms typically last less than two weeks, which is presumably too short to observe the alterations in the brain that accompany drug addiction. Here, we analyzed the phenotypic and molecular effects of nearly lifelong morphine or saccharin intake in C57BL/6J mice. We used multiple paradigms to evaluate the symptoms of compulsive drug intake: a progressive ratio schedule, intermittent access and a schedule involving a risk of punishment were programmed into an automated IntelliCage system. Gene expression profiles were evaluated in the striatum using whole-genome microarrays and further validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in the striatum and the prefrontal cortex. Mice voluntary self-administering morphine showed addiction-related behavioral pattern that included: higher motivation to work for a drug reward, increased reward seeking and increased craving. The analysis of molecular changes revealed a tolerance effect in the transcriptional response to morphine injection (20 mg/kg, ip), as well as some long-lasting alterations in gene expression profiles between the analyzed groups of animals. Interestingly, among the morphine-drinking animals, certain transcriptional profiles were found to be associated with alterations in behavior. In conclusion, our model represents a novel approach for investigating the behavioral and molecular mechanisms underlying opioid addiction. Prolonged morphine intake caused adaptive processes in the brain that manifested as altered behavior and transcriptional sensitivity to opioids.},

We observe that in young adult (5 months), mice volume of PSDs, but not the volume of the spines, is increased 26 h after the training. The training-induced growth of PSDs is specific for the dendritic spines that lack smooth endoplasmic reticulum and spine apparatuses, and requires autophosphorylation of {$\alpha$}CaMKII. Interestingly, aging alters training-induced ultrastructural remodeling of dendritic spines. In old mice, both the median volumes of dendritic spines and PSDs shift after training toward bigger values. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that formation of memory leaves long-lasting footprint on the ultrastructure of brain circuits; however, the form of circuit remodeling changes with age.},

The model employs sensor-equipped cages that track the behaviors of the individual animals via implanted radio chips. After the animals were allowed intermittent access to alcohol (three 24 h intervals every week) for 4 weeks, the proportions of licks directed toward bottles containing alcohol were 50.9\% and 39.6\% for the male and female mice, respectively. We used three approaches (i.e., quinine adulteration, a progressive ratio schedule and a schedule involving a risk of punishment) to test for symptoms of compulsive alcohol drinking. The addition of 0.01\% quinine to the alcohol solution did not significantly affect intake, but 0.03\% quinine induced a greater than 5-fold reduction in the number of licks on the alcohol bottles. When the animals were required to perform increasing numbers of instrumental responses to obtain access to the bottle with alcohol (i.e., a progressive ratio schedule), they frequently reached a maximum of 21 responses irrespective of the available reward. Although the mice rarely achieved higher response criteria, the number of attempts was ,10 times greater in case of alcohol than water. We have developed an approach for mapping social interactions among animals that is based on analysis of the sequences of entries into the cage corners. This approach allowed us to identify the mice that followed other animals in non-random fashions. Approximately half of the mice displayed at least one interaction of this type. We have not yet found a clear correlation between imitative behavior and relative alcohol preference. In conclusion, the model we describe avoids the limitations associated with testing isolated animals and reliably leads to stable alcohol drinking. Therefore, this model may be well suited to screening for the effects of genetic mutations or pharmacological treatments on alcohol-induced behaviors.},

In the current study we have investigated the possible function of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in alcohol addiction because this protein has recently emerged as an important regulator of excitatory synaptic plasticity. METHODS: For long-term studies of alcohol drinking in mice we used IntelliCages. Dendritic spines were analyzed using Diolistic staining with DiI. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to assess silent synapses. Motivation for alcohol in human subjects was assessed on the basis of a Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism interview. RESULTS: Mice devoid of MMP-9 (MMP-9 knockout) drank as much alcohol as wild-type animals; however, they were impaired in alcohol seeking during the motivation test and withdrawal. The deficit could be rescued by overexpression of exogenous MMP-9 in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Furthermore, the impaired alcohol seeking was associated with structural alterations of dendritic spines in the CeA and, moreover, whole-cell patch clamp analysis of the basal amygdala to CeA projections showed that alcohol consumption and withdrawal were associated with generation of silent synapses. These plastic changes were impaired in MMP-9 knockout mice. Finally, C/T polymorphism of MMP-9 gene at position \textendash 1562, which upregulates MMP-9 expression, correlated with increased motivation for alcohol in alcoholics. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, our results indicate a novel mechanism of alcohol craving that involves MMP9\textendash dependent synaptic plasticity in CeA.},

We analyzed functional networks and brain modularity following reexposure to alcohol. c-Fos levels in brains from animals that were reexposed to alcohol were clearly different from binge drinking animals. Structures involved in reward processing, decision making and characteristic for addictive behaviors stood out particularly. In alcohol reexposed animals differently active structures either gained or lost correlation when compared to the control group.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cognitive deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, for which no convincing pharmacological treatment option is currently available. Here, we tested spironolactone as a repurposed compound in Tcf4 transgenic mice subjected to psychosocial stress. In this `2-hit' gene by environment mouse (GxE) model, the animals showed schizophrenia-related cognitive deficits. We had previously shown that spironolactone ameliorates working memory deficits and hyperactivity in a mouse model of cortical excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) dysbalance caused by an overactive NRG1-ERBB4 signaling pathway. In an add-on clinical study design, we used spironolactone as adjuvant medication to the standard antipsychotic drug aripiprazole. We characterized the compound effects using our previously established Platform for Systematic Semi-Automated Behavioral and Cognitive Profiling (PsyCoP). PsyCoP is a widely applicable analysis pipeline based on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework aiming at facilitating translation into the clinic. In addition, we use dimensional reduction to analyze and visualize overall treatment effect profiles. We found that spironolactone and aripiprazole improve deficits of several cognitive domains in Tcf4tg x SD mice but partially interfere with each other's effect in the combination therapy. A similar interaction was detected for the modulation of novelty-induced activity. In addition to its strong activity-dampening effects, we found an increase in negative valence measures as a side effect of aripiprazole treatment in mice. We suggest that repurposed drug candidates should first be tested in an adequate preclinical setting before initiating clinical trials. In addition, a more specific and effective NRG1-ERBB4 pathway inhibitor or more potent E/I balancing drug might enhance the ameliorating effect on cognition even further.},

  abstract = {Based on recent findings that show that depletion of factor XII (FXII) leads to better posttraumatic neurological recovery, we studied the effect of FXII-deficiency on post-traumatic cognitive and behavioral outcomes in female and male mice. In agreement with our previous findings, neurological deficits on day 7 after weight-drop traumatic brain injury (TBI) were significantly reduced in FXII-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) mice. Also, glycoprotein Ib (GPIb)-positive platelet aggregates were more frequent in brain microvasculature of WT than FXII-/- mice 3 months after TBI. Six weeks after TBI, memory for novel object was significantly reduced in both female and male WT but not in FXII-/- mice compared to sham-operated mice. In the setting of automated home-cage monitoring of socially housed mice in IntelliCages, female WT mice but not FXII-/- mice showed decreased exploration and reacted negatively to reward extinction one month after TBI. Since neuroendocrine stress after TBI might contribute to trauma-induced cognitive dysfunction and negative emotional contrast reactions, we measured peripheral corticosterone levels and the ration of heart, lung, and spleen weight to bodyweight. Three months after TBI, plasma corticosterone levels were significantly suppressed in both female and male WT but not in FXII-/- mice, while the relative heart weight increased in males but not in females of both phenotypes when compared to shamoperated mice. Our results indicate that FXII deficiency is associated with efficient post-traumatic behavioral and neuroendocrine recovery.},

We have shown that the expression of the synaptic protein Homer1a correlates with depression-like behavior and its induction is a common mechanism of action of different anti\- depressant treatments. However, the mechanism of Homer1a regulation is still unknown. Methods: We combined the chronic despair mouse model (CDM) of chronic depression with different anti\- depressant treatments. Depression-like behavior was characterized by forced swim and tail suspension tests, and via automatic measurement of sucrose preference in IntelliCage. The Homer1 mRNA expression and promoter DNA methylation were analyzed in cortex and peripheral blood by qRT-PCR and pyrosequencing. Results: CDM mice show decreased Homer1a and Homer1b/c mRNA expression in cortex and blood samples, while chronic treatment with imipramine and fluoxetine or acute ketamine application increases their level only in the cortex. The quantitative analyses of the methylation of 7 CpG sites, located on the Homer1 promoter region containing several CRE binding sites, show a significant increase in DNA methylation in the cortex of CDM mice. In contrast, antidepressant treatments reduce the methylation level. Limitations: Homer1 expression and promotor methylation were not analyzed in different blood cell types. Other CpG sites of Homer1 promoter should be investigated in future studies. Our experimental approach does not distinguish between methylation and hydroxymethylation. Conclusions: We demonstrate that stress-induced depression-like behavior and antidepressant treatments are associated with epigenetic alterations of Homer1 promoter, providing new insights into the mechanism of an\- tidepressant treatment.},

  abstract = {Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deficits in maternally inherited UBE3A. The disease is characterized by intellectual disability, impaired motor skills, and behavioral deficits, including increased anxiety and autism spectrum disorder features. The mouse models used so far in AS research recapitulate most of the cardinal AS characteristics. However, they do not mimic the situation found in the majority of AS patients who have a large deletion spanning 4\textendash 6 Mb. There is also a large variability in phenotypes reported in the available models, which altogether limits development of therapeutics. Therefore, we have generated a mouse model in which the Ube3a gene is deleted entirely from the 5 UTR to the 3 UTR of mouse Ube3a isoform 2, resulting in a deletion of 76 kb. To investigate its phenotypic suitability as a model for AS, we employed a battery of behavioral tests directed to reveal AS pathology and to find out whether this model better mirrors AS development compared to other available models. We found that the maternally inherited Ube3a-deficient line exhibits robust motor dysfunction, as seen in the rotarod and DigiGait tests, and displays abnormalities in additional behavioral paradigms, including reduced nest building and hypoactivity, although no apparent cognitive phenotype was observed in the Barnes maze and novel object recognition tests. The AS mice did, however, underperform in more complex cognition tasks, such as place reversal in the IntelliCage system, and exhibited a different circadian rhythm activity pattern. We show that the novel UBE3A-deficient model, based on a whole-gene deletion, is suitable for AS research, as it recapitulates important phenotypes characteristic of AS. This new mouse model provides complementary possibilities to study the Ube3a gene and its function in health and disease as well as possible therapeutic interventions to restore function.},

Avil-ChR2 (Cre+) and ChR2-flfl control mice were exposed to blue light in a chamber once daily from P1-P5 together with their Cre-negative mother. ELP caused cortical hyperexcitability at P8-9 as assessed via multi-electrode array recordings that coincided with reduced expression of synaptic genes (RNAseq) including Grin2b, neurexins, piccolo and voltage gated calcium and sodium channels which would agree with activity-dependent synaptic pruning. Young adult Avil-ChR2 mice presented with nociceptive hypersensitivity upon heat or mechanical stimulation, which did not resolve up until one year of age. The persistent "pain" phenotype was reflected by capsaicin hypersensitivity in primary sensory neurons of aged mice as assessed by calcium imaging. Avil-ChR2 mice had no disadvantages in Maze tests of anxiety, social interaction and spatial memory, and multiple dimensions of cognitive behavior in IntelliCages. But they stood out by a high rate of repetitive nosepokes, and repetitive corner returns irrespective of success, suggesting inflexibility. Hence, optogenetic early life pain leads to pain in adult mice and repetitive behavior but without cognitive or social deficits.},

Earlier, we revealed the restoration of cognitive function in OXYS rats with signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology by CEF along with its modulating the expression of genes related to the system of amyloid beta (A{$\beta$}) metabolism in the brain. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of CEF on behavior, A{$\beta$} deposition, and associated neuroinflammation using another model of an early AD-like pathology induced by A{$\beta$}. Mice were injected bilaterally i.c.v. with A{$\beta$} fragment 25\textendash 35 to produce the AD model, while the CEF treatment (100 mg/kg/day, i.p., 36 days) started the next day after the surgery. The open field test, T-maze, Barnes test, IntelliCage, and passive avoidance test were used for behavioral phenotyping. Neuronal density, amyloid accumulation, and the expression of neuroinflammatory markers were measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. CEF exhibited beneficial effects on some cognitive features impaired by A{$\beta$} neurotoxicity including complete restoration of the fear-induced memory and learning in the passive avoidance test and improved place learning in the IntelliCage. CEF significantly attenuated amyloid deposition and neuroinflammatory response. Thus, CEF could be positioned as a potent multipurpose drug as it simultaneously targets proteostasis network and neuroinflammation, as well as glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative pathways, and neurotrophic function as reported earlier. Together with previous reports on the positive effects of CEF in AD models, the results confirm the potential of CEF as a promising treatment against cognitive decline from the early stages of AD progression.},

Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2, TLR4) are well-characterised for their role in inflammatory events, and their combined activation has been implicated in neurological diseases. We therefore determined whether TLR2 and TLR4 double gene knockout (GKO) mice showed modified behaviour and cognitive function during a 16-day test sequence that employed the automated IntelliCage test system. The IntelliCage features a home cage environment in which groups of mice live and where water reward is gained through performing various tasks centred on drinking stations in each corner of the apparatus. All mice were tested twice, one month apart (the first sequence termed ``R1''and the second ``R2''). There were fewer corner visits and nosepokes in TLR2/4 GKO compared to wild-type mice during early exploration in R1, suggesting elevated neophobia in GKO mice. Reduced exploration persisted over subsequent test modules during the dark phase. TLR2/4 GKO mice also displayed increased corner visits during drinking sessions compared to non-drinking sessions, but this was not associated with increased drinking. In subsequent, more complex test modules, TLR2/4 GKO mice had unimpaired spatial learning, but showed markedly poorer performance in a visual discrimination reversal task compared to wild-type mice. These results indicated subtle impairments in behaviour and cognitive functions due to double deficiency in TLR2 and TLR4. These finding are highly relevant to understanding the combined actions of TLR2 and TLR4 on neurological status in a range of different disease conditions.},

  abstract = {During pneumococcal meningitis, clearance of bacteria by recruited neutrophils is crucial for host protection. However, these innate immune mechanisms are often insufficient and treatment with antibiotics is necessary to prevent death. Despite this antibiotic treatment, approximately half of all survivors suffer lifelong neurological problems. There is growing evidence indicating the harmful effects of neutrophils on CNS integrity. Therefore, the present study investigated the roles of neutrophils in the acute inflammatory response and the resulting long-term neuropsychological effects in murine pneumococcal meningitis. Long-term behavioural and cognitive functions in mice were measured using an automated IntelliCage system. Neutrophil depletion with antibody 1A8 as adjunctive therapy was shown to remarkably impair survival in meningitic C57BL/6J mice despite antibiotic (ceftriaxone) treatment. This was accompanied by increased bacterial load in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and an increase in IL-1b, but decrease in TNF, within the CSF at 20 h after bacterial inoculation. In the longer term, the surviving neutrophil-depleted post-meningitic (PM) mice displayed reduced diurnal hypolocomotion compared to PM mice treated with an isotype antibody. However, they showed nocturnal hyperactivity, and greater learning impairment in a patrolling task that is believed to depend upon an intact hippocampus. The data thus demonstrate two important mechanisms: 1. Neutrophil extravasation into the CNS during pneumococcal meningitis influences the pro-inflammatory response and is central to control of the bacterial load, an increase in which may lead to death. 2. Neutrophil-mediated changes in the acute inflammatory response modulate the neuropsychological sequelae in mice that survive pneumococcal meningitis.},

Tissue concentrations of tryptophan are regulated primarily by the enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), IDO2 and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO, encoded by TDO2). Altered IDO1 and TDO activities have been linked to the perturbed serotonergic neurotransmission that may underlie certain psychopathologies. Here we assessed mice genetically modified to be deficient in IDO1, IDO2 or TDO2 for their behavior and cognitive function using an automated home cage system, the IntelliCageTM. A wellestablished behavioural and cognitive test battery was applied during two periods (Runs 1 and 2, ``R1'' and ``R2'') separated by one month. Various tryptophan-related neurochemicals also were measured in brain extracts. IDO1-/- mice displayed remarkable reductions of early diurnal exploration in the IntelliCage and this persisted in R2. In contrast, early diurnal hyperactivity was observed in IDO2-/- mice in both R1 and R2. TDO2-/- mice displayed increased diurnal and nocturnal exploration, but only in R2. Cognitive assessment suggested enhanced reference memory in IDO2-/- mice in a complex patrolling task, while TDO deficiency was associated with enhanced performance in complex patrolling and discrimination reversal tasks. Neurochemical measures showed attenuated brain serotonin levels in IDO1-/- mice and augmented tryptophan and serotonin levels in TDO2-/- animals, respectively. No neurochemical alterations were detected in IDO2-/- mice. Taken together, these findings reveal complex and dissimilar patterns of behavioral and cognitive changes induced by knockout of three different tryptophan-metabolizing enzymes.},

In C57BL/6J mice subjected to intracerebroventricular (icv) challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the chemokine CCL2 and cytokines interferon-///, interleukin (IL)-1NL, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor were prominently expressed in the brain during the acute phase of the disease. The upregulation of these immune mediators was markedly diminished in IL-18-deficient mice. Uninfected IL-18-/- mice exhibited decreases in anxiety phenotype and licking behaviour, and an increase in behavioural habituation, in an automated monitoring system (the IntelliCageTM). Without antibiotic intervention, a majority of IL-18+/+ mice developed irreversible disease after icv S. pneumoniae but this was significantly improved by deleting IL-18 gene function. IL-18+/+ mice cured of pneumococcal meningitis with four doses of ceftriaxone, initiated at 20 h post-inoculation, showed enduring sequelae. These included abnormal behavioural phenotypes featuring diurnal hypoactivity and nocturnal hyperactivity, light phobia and disrupted cognitive function. While the hyperactive phenotype was absent in the corresponding IL-18-/- survivors, cognitive impairments and behavioural deficits were still present. Overall, the results suggest that the high levels of cytokines and/or chemokines released after pneumococcal challenge provoked a series of pathological events, ultimately causing acute death. Furthermore, since only a subset of behavioural phenotypes were ameliorated in the pneumococcus-infected IL-18-/- mice, the pathological pathways causing mortality may be, at least in part, distinct from those leading to long-term neurological sequelae.},

  abstract = {Pneumococcal meningitis is a lethal form of bacterial infection in the central nervous system that often causes lifelong neurological sequelae, despite therapeutic advances. The contemporary view is that the inflammatory response to infection contributes to the functional disabilities among survivors of this disease. We previously have established a mouse model of neurobehavioural deficits, using an automated IntelliCageTM system that revealed long-term behavioural and cognitive deficits in C57BL/6J female mice cured of meningitis by ceftriaxone treatment. We now have investigated the roles of two kynurenine pathway enzymes, indoleamine dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) and tryptophan dioxygenase-2 (TDO2), in the pathomechanisms of pneumococcal meningitis. Since tryptophan metabolism has long been implicated in behavioural and cognitive modulation through the production of neuroactive compounds, we hypothesised that preventing the actions of these enzymes through gene knockout would be beneficial in mice subjected to pneumococcal infection. We found no significant effect of IDO1 or TDO2 on mortality. Post-meningitic wild-type mice showed long-term diurnal hypoactivity and nocturnal hyperactivity when they were exposed to an Intellicage adaptation test throughout both the light and dark phases. These changes were not apparent in IDO1-/- survivors, but were present in the TDO2-/- survivors. Both IDO1-/- and TDO2-/- survivors were not protected against developing long-term cognitive deficits as measured in IntelliCage-based patrolling or reversal tasks. Collectively, these observations suggest (i) involvement of the kynurenine pathway in causing some behavioural sequelae of pneumococcal meningitis and (ii) that this pathway might operate synergistically with, or independently of, other pathways to cause other aspects of neurological sequelae.},

We evaluated the long-term behavioural and cognitive sequelae in control mice and those surviving meningitis using an automated system (the IntelliCage) in which mice perform a range of behavioural and spatial tasks to obtain water rewards from conditioning units in their home cage. Surviving mice showed a number of altered behaviours relative to controls, including (i) hypoexploration when first exposed to the IntelliCage, (ii) altered activity patterns (fewer visits to conditioning stations during the light phase and more in the dark phase), (iii) avoidance of light (a constant or flashing LED stimulus), (iv) impaired spatial learning (a complex patrolling task), and (v) impaired discrimination reversal learning. Overall these results suggest photophobia and weakened learning ability in post-meningitic mice, particularly on tasks engaging hippocampal and prefrontal neural substrates. This study also demonstrates a standardised and comprehensive battery of tests that can be readily used to investigate neurological sequelae in undisturbed mice residing in a complex home cage environment.},

  abstract = {Interferon-gamma is known to play a complex modulatory role in immune defence during microbial infections. Its actions in pneumococcal meningitis, however, remain ill-defined. Here, a pathological role for IFN-c was demonstrated using a murine model of pneumococcal meningitis, in that C57BL/6J mice deficient in this pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-c\`A/\`A) showed less severe acute and long-term neuropathology following intracerebral challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The absence of IFN-c significantly lengthened the survival of mice that otherwise would have developed fatal clinical signs within two days of CNS infection. Compared to their wild-type counterparts, IFN-c\`A/\`A mice showed a diminished inflammatory response (attenuated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid) and milder brain pathologies (less BBB permeability to protein and brain haemorrhage) during the acute phase of disease. Following a full regime of antibiotic treatment, we found substantial brain injuries in the wild-type mice 10 days after infection. IFN-c\`A/\`A mice, however, showed decreased neuronal damage in both hippocampus and cortex. In the longer term (\%10 weeks p.i.), the wild-type mice that had survived meningitis due to antibiotic treatment had neurobehavioural abnormalities including diurnal hypoactivity, nocturnal hyperactivity and impaired performance in a discrimination reversal task. IFN-c\`A/\`A mice, concomitantly tested in the automated IntelliCage platform, had reduced behavioural and cognitive disorders compared to wild-type mice. Both IFN-c\`A/\`A and wild-type survivors of pneumococcal meningitis showed impaired working memory in the IntelliCage-based complex patrolling task. These observations indicate an association between IFN-c-driven acute brain pathology and the long-term neurological sequelae resulting from pneumococcal meningitis.},

Using a Yeast-2-Hybrid screen, we identified calcium calmodulin kinase 2a, Camk2a, as a prominent prey in a brain library. Camk2a is crucial for nitric oxide dependent processes of neuronal plasticity of learning and memory. Therefore, the present study assessed functions of NXN in neuronal Nestin-NXN-/- deficient mice. The NXN-Camk2a interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, and by colocalization in neuropil and dendritic spines. Functionally, Camk2a activity was reduced in NXN deficient neurons and restored with re\- combinant NXN. Proteomics revealed reduced oxidation in the hippocampus of Nestin-NXN-/- deficient mice, including Camk2a, further synaptic and mitochondrial proteins, and was associated with a reduction of mito\- chondrial respiration. Nestin-NXN-/- mice were healthy and behaved normally in behavioral tests of anxiety, activity and sociability. They had no cognitive deficits in touchscreen based learning \& memory tasks, but omitted more trials showing a lower interest in the reward. They also engaged less in rewarding voluntary wheel running, and in exploratory behavior in IntelliCages. Accuracy was enhanced owing to the loss of exploration. The data suggested that NXN maintained the oxidative state of Camk2a and thereby its activity. In addition, it supported oxidation of other synaptic and mitochondrial proteins, and mitochondrial respiration. The loss of NXN-dependent pro-oxidative functions manifested in a loss of exploratory drive and reduced interest in reward in behaving mice.},

  abstract = {Background: The need for improving throughput, validity, and reliability in the behavioral characterization of rodents may benefit from integrating automated intra-home-cage-screening systems allowing the simultaneous detection of multiple behavioral and physiological parameters in parallel. New method: To test this hypothesis, transgenic Huntington's disease (tgHD) rats were repeatedly screened within phenotyping home-cages (PhenoMaster and IntelliCage for rats), where spontaneous activity, feeding, drinking, temperature, and metabolic performance were continuously measured. Cognition and emotionality were evaluated within the same environment by means of operant learning procedures and refined analysis of the behavioral display under conditions of novelty. This investigatorindependent approach was further correlated with behavioral display of the animals in classical behavioral assays. Multivariate analysis (MVA) including Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to explore correlation patterns of variables within and across the two genotypes. Results: The automated systems traced previously undetected aspects in the phenotype of tgHD rats (circadian activity, energy metabolism, rearing), and out of those spontaneous free rearing correlated with individual performance in the accelerod test. PCA revealed a segregation by genotype in juvenile tgHD rats that differed from adult animals, being further resolved by PLS-DA detecting ``temperature'' (juvenile) and ``rearing'' (adult) as phenotypic key variables in the tgHD model. Conclusions: Intra-home-cage phenotyping in combination with MVA, is capable of characterizing a complex phenotype by detecting novel physiological and behavioral markers with high sensitivity and standardization using fewer human resources. A broader application of automated systems for large-scale screening is encouraged.},

Here, we assessed the association of adult hippocampal neurogenesis with behavioral responses to novelty, temporal and spatial sequence and reversal learning in wild, wild-derived and laboratory rodents using an automated testing apparatus, the IntelliCage. Behaviorally, DBA/2 and wild-derived house mice were quickest to explore a novel environment, wild wood mice and bank voles were slowest, and C57BL/6 intermediate. Rule learning (temporal and spatial) was fastest in wood mice and bank voles, while DBA/2 and house mice performed poorer. C57BL/6 performed similar to the house mice in the temporal task and similar to wild rodents in the spatial task. Using the number of DCX-positive neurons and proliferating, Ki67-positive cells in the septal, intermediate and temporal hippocampus as a proxy, an ANCOVA was used to test for within-group relations between neurogenesis and behavior. We found that higher numbers of DCX-positive cells in the temporal hippocampus were associated with an increased latency and a lower frequency to explore a novel environment. Temporal and spatial sequence learning was not associated with neurogenesis. In the spatial reversal task however, animals with higher septal neurogenesis showed a persevering phenotype and slower re-learning. Our findings provide strong evidence of septo-temporally segregated neurogenesis effects on behavior across five rodent strains and species. While temporal neurogenesis covaries with behavioral responses to novelty, septal neurogenesis relates to perseverance of a successfully learned spatial rule. Importantly, these associations were independent of species or strain and can be found in both wild and domesticated rodents.},

  abstract = {The discovery of adult-born neurons in the hippocampus has triggered a wide range of studies that link the new neurons to various behavioral functions. However, the role of new neurons in behavior is still equivocal. Conflicting results may be due to the difficulty in manipulating neurogenesis without off-target effects as well as the statistical approach used, which fail to account for neurogenesisindependent effects of experimental manipulations on behavior. In this study, we apply a more comprehensive statistical and conceptual approach. Instead of between-group analyses, we consider the withingroup relationships between neurogenesis and behavior (ANCOVA and mediation analysis) in a large-scale experiment, in which distinct age(3 and 5 months) and strain- (DBA and C57) related differences in basal levels of neurogenesis in mice are compared with a large number (\textasciitilde 1,500) of behavioral read outs. The analysis failed to detect any association between anxiety and motor impulsivity with neurogenesis. However, within-group adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with the reaction to novelty. Specifically, more neurogenesis is associated with a longer latency to explore and a lower frequency of exploratory actions, overall indicative of a phenotype where animals with more neurogenesis were slower to explore a novel environment. This effect is observed in 5-months-old, but not in 3-months-old mice of both strains. An association between the reaction to novelty and adult neurogenesis can have a major impact on results from previous studies using classical behavioral experiments, in which animals are tested in a\textemdash for the animal\textemdash novel experimental set-up. The neurogenesis\textendash novelty association found here is also a necessary link in the relation that has been suggested to exist between neurogenesis and psychiatric disorders marked by a failure to cope with novelty.

Poor reliability and low efficiency of traditional behavioral tests have prompted the development of new approaches to behavioral phenotyping, such as fully automated analysis of behavior in the homecage. New method: We asked whether the analysis of spontaneous behavior during the first week in the social homecage system IntelliCage could provide useful prescreening information before specialized and time consuming test batteries are run. To determine how much behavioral variation is captured in this data, we performed principal component analysis on free adaptation data of 1552 mice tested in the IntelliCage during the past years. We then computed individual component scores to characterize and compare groups of mice. Result: We found 11 uncorrelated components which accounted for 82\% of total variance. They characterize frequency and properties of corner visits and nosepokes, drinking activity, spatial distribution, as well as diurnal time course of activity. Behavioral profiles created using individual component scores were highly characteristic for different inbred strains or different lesion models of the nervous system. They were also remarkably stable across labs and experiments. Comparison with existing methods: Monitoring of mutant mice with known deficits in hippocampusdependent tests produced profiles very similar to those of hippocampally lesioned mice. Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that already the monitoring of spontaneous behavior during a week of free adaptation in the IntelliCage can contribute significantly to high throughput prescreening of mutant mice.},

EGFL7 knock-out in vivo promoted adult neurogenesis generating neurons forming additional spines which permanently integrated into the neural circuit until old age. RNA-sequencing identified the cytokine VEGF-D as a major molecular driver of this process in . vivo In behavioral studies EGFL7 knock-out mice displayed stronger maintenance of memory suggesting longer-lasting spatial memory and improved memory consolidation in the hippocampus by modulation of pattern separation in young and aged mice. Taken together, EGFL7 is an upstream regulator of the VEGF-D in adult neurogenesis and a key regulator of learning and memory.},

HMOs are associated with functional development during early life, mainly related to immunity and intestinal health. Whether HMOs elicit a positive effect on cognitive capabilities of lactating infants remains an open question. This study evaluated the role of the most abundant HMO, 2{${'}$}-fucosyllactose (2{${'}$}-FL), in synaptic plasticity and learning capabilities in rodents. Mice and rats were prepared for the chronic recording of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked at the hippocampal CA3\textendash CA1 synapse. Following chronic oral administration of 2{${'}$}-FL, both species showed improvements in input/output curves and in long-term potentiation (LTP) evoked experimentally in alert behaving animals. This effect on LTP was related to better performance of animals in various types of learning behavioral tests. Mice were tested for spatial learning, working memory and operant conditioning using the IntelliCage system, while rats were submitted to a fixed-ratio schedule in the Skinner box. In both cases, 2{${'}$}-FL-treated animals performed significantly better than controls. In addition, chronic administration of 2{${'}$}-FL increased the expression of different molecules involved in the storage of newly acquired memories, such as the postsynaptic density protein 95, phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in cortical and subcortical structures. Taken together, the data show that dietary 2{${'}$}-FL affects cognitive domains and improves learning and memory in rodents.},

Recent evidence suggests beneficial effects of pro-cannabinoid treatments. We assessed in mice levels of endocannabinoids in association with the occurrence and persistence of comparable               sequelae               after controlled cortical impact in mice using a set of long-term behavioral observations in IntelliCages, motor and nociception tests in two sequential cohorts of TBI/sham mice. TBI mice maintained lower body weights, and they had persistent low levels of brain ethanolamide endocannabinoids (eCBs: AEA, OEA, PEA) in perilesional and subcortical ipsilateral brain tissue (6~months), but rapidly recovered motor functions (within days), and average nociceptive responses were within normal limits, albeit with high variability, ranging from loss of thermal sensation to hypersensitivity. TBI mice showed persistent non-goal directed nighttime hyperactivity, i.e. they visited rewarding and non-rewarding operant corners with high frequency and random success. On successful visits, they made more licks than sham mice resulting in net over-licking. The lower the eCBs the stronger was the hyperactivity. In reward-based learning and reversal learning tasks, TBI mice were not inferior to sham mice, but avoidance memory was less stable. Hence, the major late behavioral TBI phenotype was non-goal directed nighttime hyperactivity and "over-licking" in association with low ipsilateral brain eCBs. The behavioral phenotype would agree with a "post-TBI hyperactivity disorder". The association with persistently low eCBs in perilesional and subcortical regions suggests that eCB deficiency contribute to the post-TBI psychopathology.},

Sequential testing started at 51\textendash 172 days after bilateral lesions and lasted for 154 and 218 days in two batches of mice, respectively. Spontaneous undisturbed behavioral patterns clearly separated the three groups, hippocampals being characterized by more erratic hyperactivity, and strongly impaired circadian synchronization ability. Hippocampal lesions led to deficits in spatial passive avoidance, as well as in spatial reference and working memory tasks. Impairment was minimal in rewarded preference/reversal schemes, but prominent if behavioral responses required precise circadian timing or included punishment of wrong spatial choices. No differences between sham-operated and prefrontally lesioned subjects in conditioning success were discernible. These results corroborate the view that hippocampal dysfunction spares simple spatial learning tasks but impairs the ability to cope with conflicting task-inherent spatial, temporal or emotional cues. Methodologically, the results show that automated testing and data analysis of socially kept mice is a powerful, efficient and animal-friendly tool for dissecting complex features and behavioral profiles of hippocampal dysfunction characterizing many transgenic or pharmacological mouse models.},

During the last 18 h of this interval, the mice were water deprived and then returned to the IntelliCage for a probe trial where drinking was allowed in all corners. The C57BL/6 mice developed a significant suppression of nosepoking in the punished corner during training, and the avoidance was carried over to the following probe trial. Repetition of the experiment by delivering punishment in a different corner assigned to individual mice revealed a similar performance pattern. Comparison between the different strains revealed a reduced nosepoke suppression in DBA/2 and B6D2F1 mice as compared to C57BL/6 mice in the probe trial, despite similar error rates during the training with short (1-s) air-puffs. However, the performance of the three strains in the probe trial were equalised when the air-puffs were prolonged until the end of the corner visit. Significant extinction of the nosepoke suppression occurred after 6 days. A prolonged interval (7 days) between the training and the probe trial resulted in a loss of suppression in DBA/2 mice, but not in C57BL/6 and B6D2F1 mice. Additional experiments revealed that performance in the probe trial was dependent on a complex set of intramaze cues. Testing of mice with bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus or dorso-lateral striatum revealed that learning this task was dependent on an intact hippocampus, but not on an intact striatum. In summary, the conditioned nosepoke suppression test presented here is sensitive to both genetic differences and hippocampal lesions. This test could be applied to the screening of mutant mice with impaired hippocampal functions more efficiently than those of the standard memory tests.},

LRRTM1-knockout mice have subtle morphological deficits in excitatory hippocampal synapses and were suggested to have impaired cognitive function. Here we report that LRRTM1-knockout mice exhibit an extraordinary phenotype of avoiding small enclosures. In the light\textendash dark box, the knockout mice escape to dark through a standard opening as quickly as wild-type littermates but avoid escaping through a small doorway. While all wild-type mice spontaneously enter a small tube, most knockout mice do not. This apparent aversion to enter narrow space may explain other abnormalities such as increased time in open arms in the elevated plus maze and less visits through a tunnel in the IntelliCage. Moreover, LRRTM1-knockout mice show increased social interaction, reduced nest building and MK801-induced locomotion, and slower swim speed but normal water maze learning. Since LRRTM1 is predominantly expressed in thalamus, hippocampus and limbic cortex, specific synaptic defects in those areas presumably cause these behavioural abnormalities.},

  abstract = {Animal models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders require extensive behavioral phenotyping. Currently, this presents several caveats and the most important are: (i) rodents are nocturnal animals, but mostly tested during the light period; (ii) the conventional behavioral experiments take into consideration only a snapshot of a rich behavioral repertoire; and (iii) environmental factors, as well as experimenter influence, are often underestimated. Consequently, serious concerns have been expressed regarding the reproducibility of research findings on the one hand, and appropriate welfare of the animals (based on the principle of 3Rs\textemdash reduce, refine and replace) on the other hand. To address these problems and improve behavioral phenotyping in general, several solutions have been proposed and developed. Undisturbed, 24/7 home-cage monitoring (HCM) is gaining increased attention and popularity as demonstrating the potential to substitute or complement the conventional phenotyping methods by providing valuable data for identifying the behavioral patterns that may have been missed otherwise. In this review, we will briefly describe the different technologies used for HCM systems. Thereafter, based on our experience, we will focus on two systems, IntelliCage (NewBehavior AG and TSE-systems) and Digital Ventilated Cage (DVC , Tecniplast)\textemdash how they have been developed and applied during recent years. Additionally, we will touch upon the importance of the environmental/experimenter artifacts and propose alternative suggestions for performing phenotyping experiments based on the published evidence. We will discuss how the integration of telemetry systems for deriving certain physiological parameters can help to complement the description of the animal model to offer better translation to human studies. Ultimately, we will discuss how such HCM data can be statistically interpreted and analyzed.},

  abstract = {Recently, hundreds of risk genes associated with psychiatric disorders have been identified. These are thought to interact with environmental stress factors in precipitating pathological behaviors. However, the individual phenotypes resulting from specific genotype by environment (G\texttimes E) interactions remain to be determined. Toward a more systematic approach, we developed a novel standardized and partially automatized platform for systematic behavioral and cognitive profiling (PsyCoP). Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive disturbances in Tcf4 transgenic mice (Tcf4tg) exposed to psychosocial stress by social defeat during adolescence using a ``two-hit'' G\texttimes E mouse model. Notably, TCF4 has been repeatedly identified as a candidate risk gene for different psychiatric diseases and Tcf4tg mice display behavioral endophenotypes such as fear memory impairment and hyperactivity. We use the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) concept as framework to categorize phenotyping results in a translational approach. We propose two methods of dimension reduction, clustering, and visualization of behavioral phenotypes to retain statistical power and clarity of the overview. Taken together, our results reveal that sensorimotor gating is disturbed by Tcf4 overexpression whereas both negative and positive valence systems are primarily influenced by psychosocial stress. Moreover, we confirm previous reports showing that deficits in the cognitive domain are largely dependent on the interaction between Tcf4 and psychosocial stress. We recommend that the standardized analysis and visualization strategies described here should be applied to other two-hit mouse models of psychiatric diseases and anticipate that this will help directing future preclinical treatment trials.},

  abstract = {This book presents the essentials of behavioral test methodology needed for effective study planning and high quality behavioral data collection on laboratory mice. The broad scope of behavioral testing in relation to the neurosciences is discussed, as are the fine details of various test situations. Mistakes made in past research are scrutinized and lessons are drawn about how to avoid them in future work. Diverse factors that can influence the results of behavioral experiments are discussed, ranging from the specific parameters employed in a test to the laboratory environment outside the test situation itself. Throughout the book, emphasis is placed on special issues that arise when testing genetically different mice, including inbred strains and mice with targeted mutations. This knowledge will assist an investigator who lacks formal training in behavioral psychology to build a behavioral testing lab and insure that its output meets current standards of good practice in behavioral neuroscience research. The book will be a convenient manual of procedures for daily use in studies of mouse behavior. It will be of interest even to experienced behavioural researchers, but of particular value to scientists just beginning work with mice, including undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral investigators who want to collect phenotypic data with knockout and other genetically defined mice. Constructed from materials used in a long running course on Advanced Animal Behavior at University of North Carolina-Greensboro, the book is an ideal text for a course on behavioral testing.

At the cellular level, clock regulation is established by a self-sustained Bmal1-dependent transcriptional oscillator network. However, it is still unclear how different tissues achieve a synchronized rhythmic physiology. That is, do they respond independently to environmental signals, or require interactions with each other to do so? We show that unexpectedly, light synchronizes the Bmal1-dependent circadian machinery in single tissues in the absence of Bmal1 in all other tissues. Strikingly, light-driven tissue autonomous clocks occur without rhythmic feeding behavior and are lost in constant darkness. Importantly, tissue-autonomous Bmal1 partially sustains homeostasis in otherwise arrhythmic and prematurely aging animals. Our results therefore support a two-branched model for the daily synchronization of tissues: an autonomous response branch, whereby light entrains circadian clocks without any commitment of other Bmal1-dependent clocks, and a memory branch using other Bmal1-dependent clocks to ``remember'' time in the absence of external cues.},

We assessed neurobehavioral development, and the gene expression level changes in the mouse hippocampus using RNA-seq.

Serum free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels were signifi\- cantly increased in male offspring mice with prenatal high-dose PM exposure.

We recently reported that nestin-deficient (Nes-/-) mice showed increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced Notch signaling from Nes-/- astrocytes to the neural stem cells, and impaired long-term memory. Here we assessed learning and memory of Nes-/- mice in a home cage set up using the IntelliCage system, in which the mice learn in which cage corner a nose poke earns access to drinking water. Nes-/- and wildtype mice showed comparable place learning assessed as the incorrect corner visit ratio and the incorrect nose poke ratio. However, during reversal place learning, a more challenging task, Nes-/- mice, compared to wildtype mice, showed improved learning over time demonstrated by the incorrect visit ratio and improved memory extinction over time assessed as nose pokes per visit to the previous drinking corner. In addition, Nes-/- mice showed increased explorative activity as judged by the increased total numbers of corner visits and nose pokes. We conclude that Nes-/- mice exhibit improved reversal place learning and memory extinction, a finding which together with the previous results supports the concept of the dual role of hippocampal neurogenesis in cognitive functions.},

While NMDAR1-AB exert NMDAR-antagonistic properties by receptor internalization, no firm evidence exists to date that NMDAR1-AB by themselves induce brain inflammation/encephalitis. NMDAR1-AB of all immunoglobulin classes are highly frequent across mammals with multiple possible inducers and boosters. We hypothesized that ``NMDAR encephalitis'' results from any primary brain inflammation coinciding with the presence of NMDAR1-AB, which may shape the encephalitis phenotype. Thus, we tested whether following immunization with a ``cocktail'' of 4 NMDAR1 peptides, induction of a spatially and temporally defined sterile encephalitis by               diphtheria               toxin-mediated ablation of pyramidal neurons (``DTA'' mice) would modify/aggravate the ensuing phenotype. In addition, we tried to replicate a recent report claiming that immunizing just against the NMDAR1-N368/G369 region induced brain inflammation. Mice after DTA induction revealed a syndrome comprising hyperactivity, hippocampal learning/memory deficits, prefrontal cortical network dysfunction, lasting blood brain-barrier impairment, brain inflammation, mainly in hippocampal and cortical regions with pyramidal neuronal death, microgliosis, astrogliosis, modest immune cell infiltration, regional atrophy, and relative increases in parvalbumin-positive interneurons. The presence of NMDAR1-AB enhanced the hyperactivity (psychosis-like) phenotype, whereas all other readouts were identical to control-immunized DTA mice. Non-DTA mice with or without NMDAR1-AB were free of any encephalitic signs. Replication of the reported NMDAR1-N368/G369-immunizing protocol in two large independent cohorts of wild-type mice completely failed. To conclude, while NMDAR1-AB can contribute to the behavioral phenotype of an underlying encephalitis, induction of an encephalitis by NMDAR1-AB themselves remains to be proven.},

In mouse models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) these include, among others, social affiliation, and communication deficits as well as impairments in understanding and perception of others. Most studies addressing these issues in the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J mouse, an idiopathic model of ASD, were based on short dyadic interactions of often non-familiar partners placed in a novel environment. In such stressful and variable conditions, the reproducibility of the phenotype was low. Here, we compared physical conditions and the degree of habituation of mice at the time of testing in the three chambered social affiliation task, as well as parameters used to measure social deficits and found that both the level of stress and human bias profoundly affect the results of the test. To minimize these effects, we tested social preference and network dynamics in mice group-housed in the Eco-HAB system. This automated recording allowed for long-lasting monitoring of differences in social repertoire (including interest in social stimuli) in BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J and normosocial c57BL/6J mice.

Measurements of cognition in rodents can be confounded, however, by human handling and interaction; the IntelliCage was created to circumvent these issues while measuring various facets of cognition in a social environment with water consumption as the primary motivator for task completion. Here, for the first time, we examined the behavioral performance of 3xTg-AD mice in the IntelliCage. Seven- to 9-month-old female 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic (NonTg) mice were tested for 29 days in the IntelliCage to measure prefrontal cortical and hippocampal function. We found that a higher percentage of NonTg mice (86.96\%) were able to successfully complete the training (adaptation) phases compared to their 3xTg-AD (57.14\%) counterparts. Furthermore, the 3xTg-AD mice showed impairments in attention and working memory. Interestingly, we found that differences in body and brain weight between NonTg and 3xTg-AD mice were associated with whether mice were able to complete the IntelliCage tasks. 3xTg-AD mice that completed IntelliCage tasks had lower cortical insoluble amyloid-{$\beta$}40 fractions than their 3xTg-AD counterparts who failed to complete the tasks. Collectively, these results demonstrate deficits in cognition in the 3xTg-AD mouse and inform scientists of important factors to consider when testing this transgenic model in the IntelliCage.},

  abstract = {ENGLISH) Background: Stimulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity through GABA receptor agonists is the basic mechanism of many anticonvulsant drugs. Nevertheless, many of these GABergic drugs have adverse cognitive effects. We previously found that GABA B receptors (GABABRs) in the insula regulate operant associative memory in healthy rats. The present study aimed at investigating the effects of GABABR modulation in the insula on operant associative memory in epileptic rats, along with the underlying mechanisms. Methods: The lithiumpilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was established in male Sprague\textendash Dawley rats. A 22-gauge stainless-steel guide cannula was surgically implanted into the granular insula cortex of the epileptic rats. Baclofen (125 ng/L, 1 L), CGP35348 (12.5 \textmu g/\textmu L, 1 L), or saline (1 L) was slowly infused through the guide cannula. The Intellicage automated behavioral testing system was used to evaluate operant associative memory of the epileptic rats, including non-spatial operant tasks (basic nosepoke learning and skilled nosepoke learning) and spatial operant tasks (chamber position learning). The expression of the GABABR subunits GB1 and GB2 in the insula was examined by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Results: The Intellicage tests demonstrated that baclofen significantly impaired basic nosepoke learning, skilled nosepoke learning and chamber position learning of the epileptic rats, while CGP35348 boosted these functions. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that GB1 and GB2 were expressed in the insula of the epileptic rats, and Western blotting analysis showed that baclofen enhanced while CGP35348 inhibited the expression of these subunits. Conclusion: GABABRs in the insula bidirectionally regulate both spatial and non-spatial operant associative memory of epileptic rats. Effects of GABABRs on cognition should be taken into account when evaluating new possible treatments for people with epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Background: Sleep plays an important role in memory processing. However, its role in anesthesia-induced cognitive dysfunction was not revealed. Our study sought to investigate the connection between the cognition decline and sleep\textendash wake rhythm disorders after long-term isoflurane anesthesia in mice. Also, we examined the effect of exogenous melatonin pretreatment on both cognitive function and circadian rhythm. Furthermore, we discussed whether NR2B (N-methyl\textendash D-aspartate receptor 2B subunit)\textendash CREB (cAMPresponse element binding protein) signaling pathway was involved in this course. Methods: 2-month-old male C57/BL-6J mice were submitted to long-term anesthesia using 1\% isoflurane from CT (Circadian Time) 14 to CT20. Melatonin pretreatment were conducted before anesthesia for 7 Days. Intellicage for mice and Mini-Mitter were applied to monitor spatial memory and gross motor activity which can reflect cognition and sleep\textendash wake rhythm. Messenger RNA and protein expression of right hippocampus NR2B and CREB were examined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: 6 h isoflurane anesthesia led to impaired spatial memory from Day 3 to Day 10 in mice accompanied by the disruption of sleep\textendash wake rhythm. Meanwhile, the hippocampus CREB and NR2B expression declined in step. Melatonin pretreatment ameliorated disturbed sleep\textendash wake cycle, improved isoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction, and reversed the down-regulation of CREB and NR2B expression. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that sleep\textendash wake rhythm is involved in the isofluraneinduced cognition impairment and pretreatment of melatonin has a positive effect on circadian normalization and cognition reversal. Also, NR2B\textendash CREB signaling pathway has a critical role in this process. This study provides us a new strategy for anesthesia-induced cognitive dysfunction therapy.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Until now, the treatment of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain a difficult problem. The insula is involved in empathy and sensorimotor integration, which are often impaired in individuals with ASD. Deep brain stimulation, modulating neuronal activity in specific brain circuits, has recently been considered as a promising intervention for neuropsychiatric disorders. Valproic acid (VPA) is a potential teratogenic agent, and prenatal exposure can cause autism-like symptoms including repetitive behaviors and defective sociability. Herein, we investigated the effects of continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation in the anterior insula of rats exposed to VPA and explored cognitive functions, behavior, and molecular proteins connected to autism spectrum disorder. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} VPA-exposed offspring were bilaterally implanted with electrodes in the anterior insula (Day 0) with a recovery period of 1 week. (Day 0\textendash 7). High-frequency deep brain stimulation was applied from days 11 to 29. Three behavioral tests, including three-chamber social interaction test, were performed on days 7, 13, 18, 25 and 36, and several rats were used for analysis of immediate early genes and proteomic after deep brain stimulation intervention. Meanwhile, animals were subjected to a 20 day spatial learning and cognitive rigidity test using IntelliCage on day 11. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Deep brain stimulation improved the sociability and social novelty preference at day 18 prior to those at day 13, and the improvement has reached the upper limit compared to day 25. As for repetitive/stereotypic-like behavior, self- grooming time were reduced at day 18 and reached the upper limit, and the numbers of burried marbles were reduced at day 13 prior to those at day 18 and day 25. The improvements of sociability and social novelty preference were persistent after the stimulation had ceased. Spatial learning ability and cognitive rigidity were unaffected. We identified 35 proteins in the anterior insula, some of which were intimately linked to autism, and their expression levels were reversed upon administration of deep brain stimulation.},

  abstract = {Neocortex expansion during human evolution provides a basis for our enhanced cognitive abilities. Yet, which genes implicated in neocortex expansion are actually responsible for higher cognitive abilities is unknown. The expression of human-specific ARHGAP11B in embryonic/foetal mouse, ferret and marmoset neocortex was previously found to promote basal progenitor proliferation, upperlayer neuron generation and neocortex expansion during development, features commonly thought to contribute to increased cognitive abilities. However, a key question is whether this phenotype persists into adulthood and if so, whether cognitive abilities are indeed increased. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse line with physiological ARHGAP11B expression that exhibits increased neocortical size and upper-layer neuron numbers persisting into adulthood. Adult ARHGAP11B-transgenic mice showed altered neurobehaviour, notably increased memory flexibility and a reduced anxiety level. Our data are consistent with the notion that neocortex expansion by ARHGAP11B, a gene implicated in human evolution, underlies some of the altered neurobehavioural features observed in the transgenic mice, such as the increased memory flexibility, a neocortex-associated trait, with implications for the increase in cognitive abilities during human evolution.},

  abstract = {Neuroinflammation following peripheral surgery is a pivotal pathogenic mechanism of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). However, the key site of inflammation-mediated neural damage remains unclear. Impaired mitochondrial function is a vital feature of degenerated neurons. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a crucial regulator of mitochondrial dynamics, has been shown to play an essential role in synapse formation. Here, we designed experiments to assess whether Drp1-regulated mitochondrial dynamics and function are involved in the pathological processes of POCD and elucidate its relationship with neuroinflammation. Aged mice were sub\- jected to experimental laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). We found an increase in Drp1 activation as well as mitochondrial fragmentation both in the hippocampus of mice after surgery and primary neurons after TNF exposure. Pretreatment with Mdivi-1, a Drp1 specific inhibitor, reduced this mitochondrial fragmentation. Drp1 knockdown with small interfering RNA blocked TNF-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in SH-SY5Y cells. However, the application of Mdivi-1 exhibited a negative impact on mitochondrial function and neurite growth in primary neurons. Calcineurin activity was increased in primary neurons after TNF exposure and contributed to the Drp1 activation. The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 exhibited a Drp1-independent function that mitigated mitochondrial dysfunc\- tion. Finally, we found that FK506 pretreatment ameliorated the neurite growth in neurons treated with TNF and the learning ability of mice after surgery. Overall, our research indicated a crucial role of mitochondrial function in the pathological processes of POCD, and neuronal metabolic modulation may represent a novel and important target for POCD.},

Here, we designed experiments to assess whether isoflurane target STAT3 to deliver its cytotoxicity. Mice at postnatal day 7 or 21, primary cortical neurons cultured for 5 or 14 days and human neuroglioma U251 cells were treated with isoflurane. A plasmid containing human wild-type STAT3, STAT3 anti-sense oligonucleotide, STAT3 specific inhibitor STA21, proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and calcineurin inhibitor FK506 were utilized to evaluate the influence of STAT3 levels on isoflurane-induced cytotoxicity.                          In the present study, an upregulation of STAT3 parallel with a decline in calcineurin activity as well as a decrease in the ability of isoflurane to trigger calcineurin activity and neuroapoptosis were observed in more mature neuron or brain. STAT3 survival pathway was impaired after isoflurane exposure in U251 cells and exerted a prominent effect. STAT3 disruption exaggerated isoflurane-induced oxidative injury and apoptosis, whereas, STAT3 overexpression exhibited notable cellular protection. The blockage of calcineurin activity ameliorated neural apoptosis, dendritic spine impairment and cognitive dysfunction induced by isoflurane.

The widely accepted pathogenic model states that these mutations cause AD via an increase in A{$\beta$} formation and accumulation of A{$\beta$} in Amyloid plaques. APP mutations cause early onset familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) in humans. We generated               App               -Swedish (                                App                 s                              ) knock-in rats, which carry a pathogenic               APP               mutation in the endogenous rat               App               gene. This mutation increases {$\beta$}-secretase processing of APP leading to both augmented A{$\beta$} production and facilitation of glutamate release in                                App                 s/s                              rats, via a {$\beta$}-secretase and APP-dependent glutamate release mechanism. Here, we studied 11 to 14-month-old male and female                                App                 s/s                              rats. To determine whether the Swedish               App               mutation leads to behavioral deficits,                                App                 s/s                              knock-in rats were subjected to behavioral analysis using the IntelliCage platform, an automated behavioral testing system. This system allows behavioral assessment in socially housed animals reflecting a more natural, less stress-inducing environment and eliminates experimenter error and bias while increasing precision of measurements. Surprisingly, a spatial discrimination and flexibility task that can reveal deficits in higher order brain function showed that                                App                 s/s                              females, but not                                App                 s/s                              male rats, performed significantly worse than same sex controls. Moreover, female control rats performed significantly better than control and                                App                 s/s                              male rats. The Swedish mutation causes a significant increase in A{$\beta$} production in 14-month-old animals of both sexes. Yet, male and female                                App                 s/s                              rats showed no evidence of AD-related amyloid pathology. Finally,                                App                 s/s                              rats did not show signs of significant neuroinflammation. Given that the APP Swedish mutation causes alterations in glutamate release, we analyzed Long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting form of synaptic plasticity that is a cellular basis for learning and memory. Strikingly, LTP was significantly increased in                                App                 s/s                              control females compared to both                                App                 s/s                              sexes and control males. In conclusion, this study shows that behavioral performances are sex and               App               -genotype dependent. In addition, they are associated with LTP values and not A{$\beta$} or AD-related pathology. These data, and the failures of anti-A{$\beta$} therapies in humans, suggest that alternative pathways, such as those leading to LTP dysfunction, should be targeted for disease-modifying AD therapy.},

Recently, studies have shifted their focus to the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators in the treatment of mental illnesses in the central nervous system. We conducted this study to test the behavioral changes shown by G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 knockout (GPER1 KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with MK-801-induced schizophrenia (SZ). GPER1 KO and WT mice received intraperitoneal injections of MK-801 for 14 continuous days. Behavioral, learning and memory, and social interaction changes were evaluated by using the IntelliCage system, open-field, three-chamber social interaction, and novel object recognition tests (NORT). The protein expression levels of the NR2B/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway were tested via Western blot analysis. The KO SZ group was more likely to show impaired long-term learning and memory function than the WT SZ group. Learning and memory functions were also impaired in the KO Con group. MK-801 administration to the GPER1-KO and WT groups resulted in memory deficiencies and declining learning capabilities. GPER1 deficiency downregulated the expression levels of proteins related to the NR2B/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway. Our study suggested that GPER1 played an important role in cognitive, learning, and memory functions in the MK-801-induced mouse model of SZ. The mechanism of this role might partially involve the downregulation of the proteins related to the NR2B/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway. Further studies should focus on the effect of GPER1 on the pathogenesis of SZ in vivo and in vitro.},

Although multi-copper ferroxidases (MCFs) play an important role in cellular iron metabolism and homeostasis, the mechanism of MCFs in the CNS remains unclear. Objective: The aim was to study the role of MCFs in CNS iron metabolism and homeostasis by using hephaestin/ceruloplasmin (Heph/Cp) double knockout (KO) mice. Methods: Heph/Cp double KO male mice were generated by crossing both single KO mice. In Heph/Cp KO and wildtype (WT) control mice at 4 wk and 6 mo of age, iron concentrations of selected brain regions were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and gene expressions of Heph, Cp, ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) [+ iron responsive element (IRE)], L-ferritin, H-ferritin, transferrin receptor 1 (Tfrc), and divalent metal transporter 1 (Dmt1) (+IRE) were quantitated by quantitative reverse transcriptase\textendash polymerase chain reaction. Brain region L-ferritin protein concentration, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were also determined. Learning and memory abilities in Heph/Cp KO and WT control mice at 6 mo of age were tested by the IntelliCage system (New Behavior). Results: Iron concentration was significantly higher in Heph/Cp KO mice than in WT control mice at 4 wk of age in the cortex (50\%), hippocampus (120\%), brainstem (35\%), and cerebellum (220\%) and at 6 mo of age in the cortex (140\%), hippocampus (420\%), brainstem (560\%), and cerebellum (340\%). L-Ferritin and MDA concentrations were significantly higher and SOD and GPx activities were significantly lower in the cortex, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum of KO mice than in those of WT controls at both 4 wk and 6 mo of age. Iron-related gene expressions also differed significantly between groups. Learning and memory deficits occurred in Heph/Cp KO mice at 6 mo of age. Conclusion: Mutation of both MCFs in mice induces iron accumulation in brain regions, oxidative damage, and learning and memory defects. J Nutr 2018;148:643\textendash 649.},
